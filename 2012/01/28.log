[15:58:55] <percent20> jaeger: hello
[15:59:00] <percent20> how was the lug meeting today?
[16:27:19] <jaeger> percent20: pretty decent
[16:27:30] <jaeger> we talked about finding a new place to meet since the library is a pain in the ass about rooms
[16:27:39] <jaeger> where does the web devs group meet?
[16:29:29] <groovecoder> jgmize_: https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/tulsa_health_department_restaurant_inspections_1/
[16:30:18] <jaeger> It looks like this scraper is broken!
[16:38:14] <percent20> jaeger: we meet at fab lab tulsa
[16:39:54] <jaeger> We found some info saying that meeting rooms were available for $10/hour there..
[16:39:59] <jaeger> I've not been there yet, myself
[16:52:21] <jgmize_> jaeger: you should definitely come check out the fab lab, it's awesome
[16:54:15] <jaeger> So I've heard, we talked about it quite a bit
[17:39:06] <jwhitlock> groovecoder: is jeremy still there?  Is he hacking on the tulsa transit stuff?
[17:39:33] <groovecoder> jwhitlock: no
[17:39:41] <groovecoder> jwhitlock: he's here. he's not.
[17:39:47] <jsatt|afk> jwhitlock: I'm playing around with scraperwiki stuff
[17:39:47] <groovecoder> he's not hacking on MTTA
[17:40:27] <jwhitlock> OK, I'm trying to get the trip_parser code working in some capacity
[17:40:38] <jwhitlock> even if it will be thrown away later, it bugs me that it is broken
