[17:13:36] <zerokarmaleft> percent20: do you have mongodb on your linode vm?
[17:13:46] <percent20> no.
[17:14:24] <zerokarmaleft> it'd be nice to able to persist the scores between bot uptimes
[17:14:58] <percent20> can you save it to a textfile?
[17:15:12] <zerokarmaleft> yes, but i want to overengineer it dammit
[17:15:26] <zerokarmaleft> :D
[17:15:54] <percent20> heh I understand the urge.
[17:16:11] <zerokarmaleft> it needs to scale! for up to 10 nicks!
[17:16:38] <percent20> we might have to spend some time on our hackday and we can rewrite some of it to all use mongodb and then save all logs to mongodb and we can really do some cool stuff.
[17:17:46] <groovecoder> percent20: mongodb boo!
[17:17:59] <percent20> you have another you recommend?
[17:18:19] <groovecoder> hadoop w/ hive :)

[17:19:02] <percent20> we could use Redis
[17:19:08] <groovecoder> percent20: Redis++
[17:19:21] <percent20> too bad I don't know how to use either
[17:19:32] <groovecoder> I don't know how to use Redis either but I want to
[17:19:44] <zerokarmaleft> same here, haven't checked it out yet
[17:19:58] <groovecoder> sounds perfect then :)
[17:20:35] <percent20> okay. i'd rather not experiment on a production VPS

[22:30:50] <percent20> finally found a word I was looking for and the people I was talking with about it aren't here. :(
[22:54:19] <percent20> groovecoder: so you working on tulsabot?

[22:55:14] <percent20> unless you want to work on it that is. heh
[22:58:03] <percent20> you know. I wish the django community was more active discussion wise. The ruby on rails community wont shut up, but the djanog community almost doesn't talk by comparison.
