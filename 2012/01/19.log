[01-19-2012 11:03:25] <percent20> agreed, but I think sephillips is going to loan us a server, at least last I heard anyway.
[01-19-2012 11:22:10] <groovecoder> if so right now I'm tempted to use it to just host a big couchdb or something
[01-19-2012 11:34:38] <percent20> groovecoder: I think that would be a good idea.
[01-19-2012 11:35:49] <groovecoder> just wached the end of the thunder game
[01-19-2012 11:36:09] <percent20> was it any good?
[01-19-2012 11:37:12] <groovecoder> pretty good game, bad result :(
[01-19-2012 11:37:52] <percent20> ah. Someone should be shot because of this page. http://oklahomathunder.net/about.htm
[01-19-2012 11:44:50] <percent20> dang you groovecoder adding "honest feedback only" to facebook.
[01-19-2012 20:35:03] <esdev> g'morning sleepy heads
[01-19-2012 20:35:26] <groovecoder> morning
[01-19-2012 20:42:06] <groovecoder> pretty good discussion going on facebook
[01-19-2012 20:42:29] <esdev> tulsawebdevs page?
[01-19-2012 20:42:54] <groovecoder> yeah
[01-19-2012 20:43:04] <groovecoder> re: why u no show up to meetings?
[01-19-2012 20:43:14] <esdev> o yea. lol
[01-19-2012 20:51:33] <esdev> github vs. bitbucket? what's the diff and who cares?
[01-19-2012 20:52:27] <esdev> vs. launchpad vs. koders...
[01-19-2012 20:52:38] <codelahoma> I don't care, but I think bitbucket has more for free and also supports mercurial and svn
[01-19-2012 20:53:00] <codelahoma> scratch SVN
[01-19-2012 20:53:13] <esdev> it doesn't support svn?
[01-19-2012 20:53:33] <esdev> o yea. git and mercurial
[01-19-2012 20:53:36] <codelahoma> github is very popular with ruby and node projects.
[01-19-2012 20:54:06] <codelahoma> social features are strong on github, but I have no experience with bitbucket
[01-19-2012 20:54:21] <codelahoma> I think percent20 uses them.
[01-19-2012 20:56:09] <codelahoma> I should probably move my private repos to bitbucket and save myself $7 a month.
[01-19-2012 20:56:21] <esdev> which is easier for the noob-types aka folks like me?
[01-19-2012 20:57:05] <codelahoma> I've only used github.
[01-19-2012 20:57:07] <esdev> hey $7 is $84/yr it adds up
[01-19-2012 20:57:18] <esdev> me too
[01-19-2012 21:02:03] <codelahoma> those recurring sub-$10 expenses are so easy to procrastinate on eliminating. It's the fitness club business model.
[01-19-2012 21:02:23] <esdev> yep
[01-19-2012 21:20:58] <groovecoder> codelahoma++ I have about 4 or 5 different sub-$10 monthly cloud costs.
[01-19-2012 21:21:04] <zerokarmaleft> except the fitness club adds to closer to $1000/yr
[01-19-2012 21:21:23] <codelahoma> groovecoder: same here
[01-19-2012 21:22:08] <zerokarmaleft> i'm happy with rdio and netflix replacing tv and my cd-purchasing habit
[01-19-2012 21:23:06] <codelahoma> http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/
[01-19-2012 21:23:21] <codelahoma> zerokarmaleft: Netflix, Hulu+, and MOG here.
[01-19-2012 21:23:42] <codelahoma> with two Roku, one Apple TV, and one XBox-360
[01-19-2012 21:30:33] <groovecoder> mm ... I just cancelled my (premium) github.com, screencast.com, and quantact.com accounts
[01-19-2012 21:30:38] <groovecoder> feels great
[01-19-2012 21:30:45] <groovecoder> I'm keeping Pandora
[01-19-2012 21:30:51] <groovecoder> and Rackspace
[01-19-2012 21:30:55] <esdev> lunch is on groovecoder
[01-19-2012 21:31:38] <codelahoma> what's the benefit of premium Pandora?
[01-19-2012 21:32:39] <groovecoder> codelahoma: no commercials
[01-19-2012 21:35:14] <codelahoma> ahh...I guess I don't listen to it enough to notice the commercials
[01-19-2012 21:44:31] <esdev> django installed. movin' on up
[01-19-2012 21:46:05] <esdev> bbl folks
[01-19-2012 22:17:58] <zerokarmaleft> how much interest do you guys have in something like hadoop?
[01-19-2012 22:18:22] <zerokarmaleft> for a meeting presentation
[01-19-2012 22:18:38] <codelahoma> my interest is only academic
[01-19-2012 22:18:59] <zerokarmaleft> it's not quite webdev, but more data-centric
[01-19-2012 22:21:59] <zerokarmaleft> barring that, i could talk about scraping since i don't think i'll be able to make the hack day
[01-19-2012 22:26:59] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: I've done *some* hadoop ... I don't know if any of us are dealing with that much data?
[01-19-2012 22:27:15] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: I thought you wanted to talk about clojure in Feb?
[01-19-2012 22:28:01] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: clojure+hadoop or clojure+scraping
[01-19-2012 22:28:21] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: ooo, if you can do clojure+scraping on heroku that would rock
[01-19-2012 22:28:47] <groovecoder> we could invite Tulsa Java to the meeting and might get some Java hackathon signups
[01-19-2012 22:29:42] <zerokarmaleft> ok
[01-19-2012 22:31:34] <zerokarmaleft> "Scraping the Web with Clojure on Heroku" it is, then
[01-19-2012 22:33:56] <groovecoder> cool
[01-19-2012 22:34:00] <zerokarmaleft> apropos of nothing, i'm idly wondering if i just installed some draconian adobe drm shit on my windows partition
[01-19-2012 22:35:20] <groovecoder> though I have to say going thru http://tryclj.com/ I don't really like typing all these () characters ... I guess there are just as many in python, but they feel like they're in a more sane location in python? ;)
[01-19-2012 22:40:10] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: that's a minor syntax issue
[01-19-2012 22:40:38] <zerokarmaleft> easily remedied with editor support, similar to enforced whitespace :P
[01-19-2012 22:53:49] <zerokarmaleft> http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q1/200 <= wtf
[01-19-2012 22:55:36] <groovecoder> holy crap
[01-20-2012 00:14:18] <groovecoder> ACTION loves refactoring code when there are tests around it
[01-19-2012 13:37:55] <percent20> tulsabot: why you disconnect and reconnect?
[01-19-2012 13:43:00] <percent20> https://github.com/tulsawebdevs/irclogs
[01-19-2012 13:46:08] <percent20> so many snarks i can make on that facebook thread. i'm just going to not do it though
[01-19-2012 13:48:01] <percent20> lol Steven Copely hates south tulsa. Well guess what I hate down town tulsa and the surrounding area, but I buck it up and go.
[01-19-2012 14:02:48] <groovecoder> percent20: heh, yeah. let's not even ask Steven what his opinion of Oklahoma City is ;)
[01-19-2012 14:18:59] <percent20> groovecoder: heh yeah.
[01-19-2012 14:20:12] <percent20> just did a 25 minute walk. Yeah I am more tired from that than 35 minutes jogging on an elliptical.
[01-19-2012 14:27:51] <Destos> uphill? :P
[01-19-2012 14:28:39] <percent20> part of it was an incline, but not much at all. maybe 3 or 4*
[01-19-2012 14:32:01] <percent20> probably a bit more than that, but not by much.
[01-19-2012 14:36:21] <percent20> https://twitter.com/daveramsey/status/160082362955337728
[01-19-2012 14:37:58] <codelahoma> catchy, but I'm not sure what the lesson is.
[01-19-2012 14:38:28] <codelahoma> Kodak was a supply company. They never were competitive as a camera manufacturer.
[01-19-2012 14:40:04] <percent20> true, however, it could be pitched to others and a joint venture started.
[01-19-2012 14:40:38] <percent20> or they could have ponied up and come into the camera market.
[01-19-2012 14:41:33] <groovecoder> best SOPA tweet ever: https://twitter.com/#!/gabie53/status/159688586126573572
[01-19-2012 14:42:51] <percent20> too much oatmeal at once. just burned my mouth.
[01-19-2012 14:43:10] <percent20> that is funny, but sooooo many problems with it.
[01-19-2012 14:44:22] <codelahoma> I'm not sure there was a way for Kodak to succeed. I think they're the buggywhip manufacturers of the 21st century.
[01-19-2012 14:46:14] <percent20> here is an image of before and after the tsunami in japan. http://josephta.me/2011/12/the-art-of-running-recovery-in-ishinomaki/
[01-19-2012 14:46:29] <percent20> actuall no that isn't hold a sec
[01-19-2012 14:46:50] <percent20> here we go. http://josephta.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/letter-H.jpg
[01-19-2012 14:47:11] <groovecoder> lmao: https://gist.github.com/1641705
[01-19-2012 14:47:19] <groovecoder> (can you tell I'm on lunch break?)
[01-19-2012 14:47:53] <percent20> wait you work?
[01-19-2012 14:47:55] <percent20> ;)
[01-19-2012 14:50:02] <percent20> i want to be in the position of the guy that just wrote that ;)
[01-19-2012 14:50:07] <percent20> ol

[01-19-2012 14:55:39] <groovecoder> we should make a field trip out to the pryor data center
[01-19-2012 14:56:24] <codelahoma> could we do anything besides look at it from the outside?
[01-19-2012 14:56:25] <percent20> i hate when people do stuff like that with titles and oklahoma
[01-19-2012 14:56:33] <percent20> I agree with codelahoma
[01-19-2012 14:58:42] <percent20> groovecoder:  don't you have a google key card?
[15:09:48] <percent20> test message. :)
[15:09:58] <Destos> another test message
[15:10:44] <percent20> ty
[15:11:23] <Destos> another belated test message
[15:11:27] <percent20> https://github.com/tulsawebdevs/irclogs/blob/master/2012/01/19.log <- bottom looks much better now.
[15:12:19] <percent20> still off by an hour since server is on eastcoast
[15:16:18] <percent20> would be cool to do each line in markdown so we can get some rich text and linkify links and make it easier to consume
[15:23:25] <sephillips> So what you are saying is that everything I say in here is preserved for posterity?
[15:23:36] <percent20> http://www.neowin.net/news/megaupload-charged-with-piracy-shut-down
[15:23:48] <percent20> yes. mostly though I am after saving links
[15:24:10] <percent20> we have lost a few to the void.
[15:25:32] <sephillips> hmm...the Megaupload story makes me wonder why anyone thought they needed SOPA/PIPA?
[15:28:06] <percent20> well, we "need" it to block foreign pirates.
[15:28:47] <percent20> that is why the whole "great firewall of america" was going around. We can just remove dns stuff from foreign sites so we can't get there.
[15:39:14] <percent20> groovecoder: I removed the mozilla code from C25k app and now it partially works as local app.
[15:39:32] <percent20> getting closer
[15:43:39] <percent20> I like how I update the code on github and it essentially updates everyone elses app in the world.
[15:50:47] <percent20> https://github.com/applidium/Vim <- vim for ioss
[15:50:49] <percent20> ios*
[15:52:52] <groovecoder> if I catch anyone writing code on their iOS device, I'm revoking their github access :)
[15:53:13] <percent20> even on my iPad in a doctors office?
[15:54:16] <percent20> I have wanted vim on my iPad for a while now.
[15:54:59] <percent20> http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vim/id492668168?mt=8&ls=1
[16:02:54] <percent20> groovecoder: its amazing the amount of effort going into building vagrant up at mozilla.
[16:08:30] <groovecoder> I thought apple denied gpl software from app store?
[16:09:07] <groovecoder> percent20: what do you mean?
[16:09:28] <percent20> groovecoder: me too. apparently they forgot their own gpl policy.
[16:09:40] <percent20> groovecoder: it seems like everytime I jump into a mozilla channel they are talkign about bagrant
[16:09:44] <percent20> vagrant*
[16:10:17] <groovecoder> yeah
[16:10:42] <groovecoder> I'm using it now too, but I don't know that I like it any better than just a sane README and requirements.txt
[16:11:44] <groovecoder> there's stuff you can do with vagrant & puppet that you just can't automate any other way though. e.g., import a scrubbed dump of production data locally, automatically set up MindTouch integration, etc.
[16:12:25] <groovecoder> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIuTnhdTzK0 is making the rounds in Mozilla now
[16:26:55] <sephillips> So who wants the access info for the first VM for Okiedata.org
[16:27:29] <groovecoder> what OS is it running? ;)
[16:27:36] <groovecoder> (also, incredible: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/bouncy-and-the-apple)
[16:28:55] <sephillips> MS of course!
[16:29:27] <groovecoder> hmm ... I got nothing for it then :(
[16:29:32] <sephillips> ...Centos 6.2
[16:29:41] <groovecoder> better, better ...
[16:30:14] <groovecoder> sephillips: email me the access creds. I might try to throw couchdb up there when I do more scraper hacking tonight
[16:30:36] <percent20> groovecoder: you should do some scraper blogging too ;)
[16:31:28] <groovecoder> percent20: I plan to write a python + github + heroku + socrata blog post at tulsawebdevs.org. the last one actually brought a comment from the Socrata dev evangelist! and might have given us a lead into some hackathon sponsorship money! :)
[16:31:47] <percent20> yay :)
[16:32:42] <sephillips> groovecoder: your wish is my command...
[16:33:36] <percent20> well I am off to school not sure which is going to be more fun school or the django docs I have read for the last couple of hours.
[16:33:45] <percent20> ttyl
[16:34:05] <Destos> cya tomorrow percent20
[16:51:19] <groovecoder> sephillips: i386? x86_64?
[17:35:09] <percent20> i like when textbooks ask cliched math questions of which I already know the answer.
[18:10:14] <percent20> you can tell its 5pm ;)
[18:29:59] <percent20> there now at 2 am every morning all git logs should be pushed to github. :)
[18:30:16] <percent20> or is it midnight?
[19:14:38] <sephillips> groovecoder: Did you have a question?
[19:30:27] <groovecoder> sephillips: is this box i386 or x86_64? (32-bit or 64-bit?)

[21:35:37] <sephillips> groovecoder: 64
[21:35:54] <groovecoder> tulsabot: botsnack
[21:38:55] <percent20> groovecoder: there isn't any functionality for that, but you can add it ;)
[21:39:46] <percent20> if you can think of any plugins you might want to see let me know i'll see if i can't hunt something down.
[21:43:42] <percent20> groovecoder: just so you know I am going to be a couple hours late to coworking.
[21:56:05] <groovecoder> percent20: there's no "late" to coworking. it's show-up-when-you-can
[21:57:47] <groovecoder> :)
[21:58:12] <percent20> well late based on when i usually get there.
[21:59:31] <percent20> groovecoder: can you explain kwargs to me? I understand that they are keyword arguments, but how does one know what to use in them? in django it almost seems arbitrary what people use and i am not sure how to figure out what to use and when.
[22:00:46] <groovecoder> percent20: good question. for me it's mostly a matter of taste. but I don't know if there's a real Python Way™ to determine then when and why of kwargs vs. args
[22:01:22] <groovecoder> I think mainly you use kwargs to pass-thru optional arguments
[22:03:33] <percent20> seems like a "if you don't know how and what to use you don't need to use it" type thing.
[22:09:56] <percent20> Many vegans regard honey as an animal product and avoid it. <- geh
[22:33:34] <percent20> you know being able to read django framework code is cool and all. Except when you don't understand what they are doing :(
[22:38:56] <percent20> groovecoder: you around? am curios if you experiment trying to figure out new parts of django and if so how you do it.
[22:39:04] <percent20> for example I am trying to figure out https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/class-based-views/#formview
[22:39:23] <percent20> however, I am not sure how to test it and figure out what it is doing, and how it works with templates.
[23:03:26] <zerokarmaleft> !seen percent20
[23:03:39] <percent20> yeah don't have that plugin
[23:04:46] <percent20> however it is a pull request away. https://github.com/tulsawebdevs/ircbot
[23:23:48] <zerokarmaleft> percent20: testing a karma plugin from scratch in #zerokarmaleft
[23:53:56] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: got regex-fu?
