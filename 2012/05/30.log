[10:52:51] <groovecoder> I think I finally figured out my turntable.fm issue - I had firebug enabled ;)
[11:00:22] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: lol
[11:00:53] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: one of those "where the hell is my hat?!" problems
[11:03:35] <zerokarmaleft> lol: "Decided to browse the web as User-Agent: Batman/1.0 under Chrome today. Disappointed by how many things don't work due to a silly header."
[11:51:29] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: have you read The Art of Community?
[11:52:14] <zerokarmaleft> wtf, i just got a picture of a thermostat or something as part of a captcha
[11:54:56] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: yeah, I've read it
[11:55:37] <zerokarmaleft> too many books to read
[12:03:35] <groovecoder> MrMakeIt: nice coldplay playlist going on :)
[12:06:25] <MrMakeIt> groovecoder: thanks
[12:07:20] <percent20_> maybe I can listen when i get home
[12:07:39] <percent20_> we aren't allowed to stream music up here :(
[12:09:48] <MrMakeIt> well that's no fun.
[12:31:51] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: brilliant
[12:31:57] <zerokarmaleft> :D
[12:32:11] <groovecoder> an air hostess in the 60's
[12:32:17] <groovecoder> uhn
[12:32:55] <zerokarmaleft> i'll buy you a kebab!
[12:33:03] <groovecoder> lol
[12:35:33] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: whoa, never heard this version before
[12:36:22] <zerokarmaleft> affirmative
[12:38:07] <MrMakeIt> wow, read a comic about robots, get a song about robots.
[12:45:13] <groovecoder> percent20_: does turntable.fm work fine for you in Firefox?
[12:45:44] <groovecoder> I wonder if they did something based on my IP since I was gaming it by signing in from multiple devices ... though that would have applied to Fab Lab too
[12:45:56] <percent20_> groovecoder: yes, I am running v12 at the moment.
[12:46:30] <percent20_> what is wrong?
[12:47:28] <percent20_> yeah that sucked. song was really jittery for me because of bandwidth problems. :(
[12:47:52] <percent20_> I will definitely have to wait until i get home. :(
[12:49:11] <groovecoder> hah. OH in #webdev: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1651879
[12:49:49] <percent20_> lol.
[12:51:50] <percent20_> Thing I hate about working at a place that does IVR development. I get to hear phones dial and automated voices the entire time I am here.
[12:56:25] <percent20_> groovecoder: looks like I might be messing a bit with webgl in a month or so. heh.
[12:56:46] <groovecoder> percent20_: cool
[12:56:59] <percent20_> we shall see how well it goes.
[12:57:06] <groovecoder> percent20_: enhancing thingaview?
[12:57:36] <percent20_> possibly. what is interesting is they don't use thingaview anymore I don't think. I tried to find the feature on their site and it isn't there anymore.
[13:00:32] <percent20_> Looks like my jeep will be paid off next month :D
[13:00:45] <zerokarmaleft> percent20_: nice! such a great feeling
[13:01:08] <percent20_> I am looking foward to the feeling. :)
[13:02:07] <percent20_> it is frustrating to be so very close, but not have quite enough to kill it all in one payment.
[13:27:57] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: I gold-starred this song on Rock Band
[13:32:38] <zerokarmaleft> on expert?
[13:45:44] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: of course
[13:45:46] <groovecoder> ;)
[13:46:07] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: incidentally, I'm also a Very Good Liarâ„¢
[13:46:24] <zerokarmaleft> on irc, everyone's a woman
[14:01:55] <groovecoder> wow, Microsoft's Windows 8 app submission process is a PITA
[14:49:01] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=PEyk63UaBI4 <= diablo 3 inferno tactic
[14:50:44] <groovecoder> heh
