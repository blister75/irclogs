[13:59:38] <percent2_> groovecoder: you around?
[13:59:43] <groovecoder> yeah
[13:59:55] <percent2_> i've been thinking...
[14:00:21] <percent2_> I need to get some fairly generic business cards and I have been trying to come up with something to describe what I do.
[14:01:04] <percent2_> was curios if you had any ideas. I want to convey that I am a freelance developer that specializes in mobile, emergeing web technologies and training.
[14:01:20] <percent2_> but my brain doesn't want to function in helping me slim that down.
[14:53:01] <zerokarmaleft> just get rid of all the buzzwords
[14:53:08] <zerokarmaleft> Web Developer
[14:53:13] <zerokarmaleft> Training Consultant
[14:54:25] <groovecoder> percent20: hmm, yeah I'm not sure. "Consultant" is probably the closest title to suit you :)
[14:55:01] <groovecoder> also, I've done that a few times now when someone says, "Hey are you there?" and I say "yeah" and then I immediately leave for an hour. sorry all! :(
[14:55:06] <groovecoder> percent20: ^
[14:55:20] <groovecoder> !groovecoder--
[14:55:25] <percent20> groovecoder: used to it.
[14:55:32] <groovecoder> percent20: that's sad. :(
[14:55:39] <percent20> groovecoder: you aren't the only person that does it.
[14:56:03] <percent20> what is more annoying is when somene else asks if I am here I say yes then they leave for an hour.
[14:56:16] <groovecoder> percent20: I know. :( it's like we have to include our handles in every message just to get the ping
[16:44:25] <groovecoder> hah. just got this in Mozilla email:
