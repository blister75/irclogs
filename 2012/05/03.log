[17:07:54] <percent20> Destos: I am starting a Node.js project next week. :)
[17:08:08] <Destos> a largeish project?
[17:08:26] <Destos> Anyone going to see Avengers tonight?
[17:08:40] <percent20> I was thinking about going, but have no one to go with. Largish yes.
[17:08:52] <percent20> going to learn backbone.js as well.

[17:10:09] <percent20> yeah. going to use socket.io with backbone.js
[17:10:49] <percent20> as of now the biggest challenge though is going to be account creation/group management stuff.
[17:10:49] <Destos> nifty, its definitely something I've dabbled with quite a bit
[17:11:19] <Destos> there are a lot of node.js -> socket.io -> backbone.js projects/helpers out there as well
[17:11:30] <Destos> skull.io was one I found a while ago
[17:11:55] <percent20> will look around at those. I remember hearing something about skull.io i'll look at that one too.
