[09:55:27] <MattGalloway> morning
[09:56:56] <Destos> mornin
[10:04:08] <percent20> hello.
[12:13:45] <groovecoder> percent20: where you at? near south tulsa?
[12:13:46] <groovecoder> :)
[12:16:59] <percent20> I am in sapalupa
[12:17:09] <percent20> I can make my way to south tulsa area.
[12:17:27] <percent20> groovecoder: ^
[12:18:27] <groovecoder> percent20: okay I might be able to go around 3:30 or so. but my phone is dead so I need to charge it a bit to call the Mrs.
[12:19:16] <percent20> groovecoder: okay sounds good to me.
[12:19:39] <percent20> i'll message you around 3:00 to see if you are still able.
[13:38:25] <groovecoder> percent20: dang, I forgot we're pushing MDN code @ 4pm so I probably can't do 3:30 :(
[13:42:57] <percent20> groovecoder: okay. so not today then?
[13:43:27] <groovecoder> probably not, unless I get free this evening. but since I was out last evening that's unlikely ;)
[13:43:37] <percent20> okay.
[13:48:38] <groovecoder> sorry man
[13:49:55] <percent20> no problem.
[15:25:08] <groovecoder> percent20: you see the websockets derby submissions so far?
[15:25:09] <groovecoder> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/devderby
[15:40:48] <percent20> those are cool.
[19:12:30] <percent20> groovecoder: you around?
