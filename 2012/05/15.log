[09:49:05] <MattGalloway> What's the URL for the Oklahoma Open Data site that groovecoder setup?
[09:49:16] <groovecoder> oklahomadata.org ?
[09:49:35] <MattGalloway> Yes. You'd think I could have guessed that. :)
[09:49:37] <groovecoder> or http://whereyourmouth.is/ ?
[09:51:38] <MattGalloway> I needed the URL for the Boundary Service Demo to send to Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives.
[09:51:44] <groovecoder> wtf? why is this on newson6.com? http://www.newson6.com/story/17790695/rewarding-21st-century-skills-with-mozilla-open-badges
[09:51:57] <groovecoder> MattGalloway: cool
[09:54:56] <MattGalloway> Groovecoder: Are you going to be at co-working this week?  I'm going to try to make it and wanted to put my Boundary Service iOS app code on Web Dev's GitHub. I was hoping you could hold my hand... figuratively speaking.
[09:55:31] <MattGalloway> Although, if you wanna actually hold my hand, I'm cool with that too.
[10:01:55] <groovecoder> MattGalloway: yup. I'll bring my hand-holding gloves
[12:15:56] <percent2_> groovecoder: was going to tell you I ran the installation pull request and it worked, but looks like it was already merged.
[12:16:12] <groovecoder> percent2_: heh, cool
[17:44:30] <percent2_> MattGalloway: you around?
[20:19:04] <percent20> !weather
