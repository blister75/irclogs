[13:03:22] <percent20> is tulsawebdevs online dieing? its been very very quite over the last month.
[13:09:48] <zerokarmaleft> on irc?
[13:10:25] <zerokarmaleft> i've just been busy, finals and projects and herding cats
[13:11:26] <percent20> both irc and facebook. mostly irc though.
[13:11:48] <percent20> and co-working has slowed as well, but that isn't onlin
[13:16:35] <zerokarmaleft> hmm, my homebrew repository seems to be effed up
[13:19:03] <percent20> that is no fun.
[13:32:05] <zerokarmaleft> oh i see, i'm running from my own fork
[13:32:39] <zerokarmaleft> i did that a year ago and forgot about it
[16:59:27] <Destos> percent20: is all my fault by getting a job.
[17:08:55] <percent20> ah okay. Then you should quit so it is more lively in here. I think that is the solution.
[17:15:06] <percent20> I am curios the ratio of made up statistics vs exagerated vs just plain wrong is.
[17:45:25] <Destos> there is not such thing as accurate statistics
[18:40:05] <codelahoma> Destos: Do you have numbers to back up that statement?
[18:40:39] <Destos> codelahoma: 42% of statistics are innacurate
