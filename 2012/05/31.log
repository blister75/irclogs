[08:34:16] <Destos> mornin peeps
[08:35:18] <groovecoder> morning
[08:35:26] <groovecoder> how's the CA world today?
[08:35:55] <Destos> interesting, we moved to new offices Tuesday
[08:36:22] <Destos> and it appears the collabatorium is moving out of their space.
[08:36:34] <groovecoder> Destos: orly?
[08:36:48] <Destos> and I almost responded to that job listing on fb
[08:37:26] <Destos> as far as the collar, not entirely sure whats going on only that something happened with the space
[08:37:29] <Destos> collab*
[10:59:14] <groovecoder> Destos: almost responded? do tell.
[10:59:31] <Destos> I believe I've already told you how I feel about that company
[10:59:44] <groovecoder> percent20: if you're getting into WebGL, why not be the topic driver on MDN? https://developer.mozilla.org/Project:en/Topic_drivers
[10:59:58] <groovecoder> oh, right
[11:00:07] <groovecoder> Destos: I forgot it was GuRuStu
[11:00:41] <groovecoder> I want to have a "How should we engage with local web companies" discussion sometime in the group - probably over a beer
[11:01:17] <Destos> Thats should be interesting
[11:01:46] <Destos> When I initially was looking for a job a couple years ago it was interesting/hard to find all the companies as well
[11:02:07] <Destos> maybe we should build a directory
[11:02:18] <groovecoder> Destos: exactly. now I know of InterWorks, Vitals, CA, GuRuStu, Cubic ... probably missing some
[11:03:23] <Destos> oh wait Carlos already beat us to it
[11:03:24] <Destos> http://tulsawebdesign.com/
[11:04:43] <groovecoder> !Destos++
[11:04:56] <Destos> yay more awesome points for doing nothing! ;p
[11:05:14] <Destos> my semicolon key got fudged during the move, me is sad
[11:06:22] <groovecoder> Destos: semicolon? wtf do you need that for w/ coffeescript and python?
[11:07:07] <Destos> surprisingly there is a character called a colon that I need somewhat often
[11:07:44] <zerokarmaleft> rebind caps lock
[11:42:50] <mrmakeit> Destos: do you know the best way to auth to node.js?
[11:44:34] <groovecoder> mrmakeit: what do you mean "auth to node.js" ?
[11:45:05] <mrmakeit> auth to a page served by node.js.
[11:45:41] <mrmakeit> so if a person logs in i can give them a different page.
[11:49:45] <mrmakeit> I'd need it to work with the Express module
[11:51:10] <groovecoder> mrmakeit: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3498005/user-authentication-libraries-for-node-js
[11:51:11] <groovecoder> ?
[11:51:56] <groovecoder> mrmakeit: question - what are you writing w/ node?
[11:52:28] <mrmakeit> webcast streaming client w/extras.
[11:53:53] <groovecoder> mrmakeit: oh yeah. does node have some cool features for that?
[11:55:03] <mrmakeit> i'm mostly using websockets to get the commands where i need them.
[11:55:19] <mrmakeit> but i have found preloading a page to be useful.
[12:01:03] <zerokarmaleft> ACTION has earned 1 point in elisp-fu
[12:01:30] <zerokarmaleft> talk about yak-shaving
[12:06:08] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: the next nodeknockout is in august
[12:06:28] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: oh?
[12:06:33] <zerokarmaleft> http://nodeknockout.com/
[12:08:47] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: that's cool. I wonder how they track/enforce the 48-hour limit?
[12:09:29] <zerokarmaleft> We’ll be watching to make sure people don’t cheat (don’t think you can develop everything ahead of time and push it all at the end; we know lots of git tricks too).
[12:10:36] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: fair enough. what I'm really interested in is a site/app framework for running competitions like that. percent20: you still working on that at all?
[12:11:23] <Destos> mrmakeit: back from lunch
[12:14:49] <mrmakeit> Destos: hey
[12:16:03] <Destos> sent you a pm with links
[13:20:07] <percent20> groovecoder: basically they have a team of people watching your github repo and you are mandated to use a git repository they provide.
[13:20:53] <percent20> as part of those competetions it is up to you to host your project so all they need is a list of entrants and scores for each judge, that is about it.
[13:42:47] <MrMakeIt> Destos: think i finally got it done.
[13:43:09] <MrMakeIt> now just need to make it look nice
[13:43:21] <Destos> wewt
[13:43:24] <Destos> learn some css!
[13:44:25] <MrMakeIt> actually, already did.  had to for the radio page.
[13:47:16] <MrMakeIt> and now on GitHub. https://github.com/blister75/HTML5-Radio-Control
[13:51:50] <MrMakeIt> when did you guys find turntable.fm
[13:52:30] <groovecoder> MrMakeIt: we started doing it last Friday
[13:52:47] <MrMakeIt> ah.
[13:53:14] <MrMakeIt> where do you find stuff like that?
[13:53:25] <groovecoder> MrMakeIt: I forget where we heard about that
[13:58:52] <percent20> groovecoder: why aren't YOU in turntable.fm/tulsawebdevs
[14:01:18] <MrMakeIt> good question.
[14:02:59] <MrMakeIt> anyone else notice the PC LOAD LETTER when starting a song?
[14:03:58] <MrMakeIt> !groovecoder--
[14:04:35] <MrMakeIt> !groovecoder++
[14:04:36] <MrMakeIt> !groovecoder++
[14:42:31] <percent20> !Destos++
[14:42:40] <Destos> :o
[14:42:56] <Destos> why is your song taking forever, can't hear it :/
[14:44:44] <Destos> can't hear musiacccccc /
[14:44:46] <Destos> :/
[14:44:54] <percent20> is your comp on mute?
[14:45:38] <Destos> nope
[14:46:43] <percent20> reboot.
[14:47:57] <Destos> it was firefox, chrome works, turned off adblock as well but to no avail
[14:48:46] <percent20> that is two people other than me that has issues with firefox.
[14:49:32] <Destos> with turntable?
[14:49:37] <Destos> maybe they pushed up bad code
[14:50:01] <percent20> yes
[14:53:23] <groovecoder> Destos: yeah I had that issue too
[14:54:35] <groovecoder> Destos: I didn't try to disable ABP, but I'm trying with DNT+ disabled
[14:55:34] <Destos> groovecoder: figured it might have been blocking a flash player, unless they use html5 audio
[14:55:54] <Destos> nice lid there groovecoder
[14:56:18] <groovecoder> Destos: I don't think they do, there's an SWF on the page and then there's a bunch of application/octet-stream requests
[14:57:42] <groovecoder> and IIRC when I disabled Flash it said it requires it :(
[15:03:15] <groovecoder> Destos: hmm ... Aurora had an update last night and so far it's working fine w/ turntable.fm
[15:03:56] <groovecoder> gah! as soon as I said that it crapped out!
[15:04:27] <groovecoder> though I think it's a bug w/ turntable.fm b/c Pandora doesn't have that issue and it does the same SWF + application/octet-stream
[15:05:06] <percent20> I am using FF12 and it is working fine.
[15:06:13] <zerokarmaleft> codelahoma: https://github.com/swank-js/swank-js
[15:07:41] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swank ?
[15:08:01] <zerokarmaleft> just about the same connotation
[15:08:18] <zerokarmaleft> web socket connection b/w emacs and an in-browser javascript engine
[15:08:35] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: ooo, neat
[15:08:55] <groovecoder> for ... ? repl ?
[15:09:05] <zerokarmaleft> yea, for REPL
[16:05:50] <Destos> off to the fab lab
[16:11:53] <MrMakeIt> groovecoder:  Next time besure to mark NSFW.
[16:51:50] <percent20> what was NSFW?
[17:33:27] <MrMakeIt> groovecoder:  So apparently I'm suppose to ask you what you do for mozilla as an employee
