[06:30:48] <groovecoder|afk> can someone post http://www.doodle.com/bgp7gcicidf4ixs6#table to the facebook group?
[06:31:36] <groovecoder|afk> as if anyone is awake yet :)
[11:05:15] <groovecoder|afk> Destos! Sean W is anxious about tulsaschoolofdev.com ...
[11:06:00] <groovecoder|afk> oh, just saw your email
[11:15:48] <Destos> yeah, sorry about that.
[11:58:48] <groovecoder|afk> Destos: np
[11:59:12] <groovecoder|afk> Destos: don't mean to push, just curious
[11:59:41] <groovecoder|afk> this year's site will be 10x better than last year, so if it takes 1.1x as long to make that should be fine :)
[18:47:45] <Destos> groovecoder|afk: let me know if you have time tonight to talk about SOD
[19:11:29] <percent20> sod is cool makes the grown greener ;)
[19:13:43] <Destos> son of a ditch
[19:14:15] <Destos> Feeling better percent20 ?
[19:14:33] <percent20> Destos: yes thank you.
[19:14:42] <percent20> am actually going to attempt a run tomorrow night
[19:14:49] <Destos> coolio
[19:15:22] <Destos> I started contracting at consumer affairs so I've biked downtown the last few days
[19:15:25] <Destos> and I'm feeling it
[19:16:02] <percent20> nice. they going to hire you away from us?
[19:16:17] <Destos> ACTION looks around
[19:16:35] <percent20> well we never see CA people again :(
[19:17:04] <Destos> I hope not. I'v let them know I'm mostly interested in contracting, and for the they of work they will need I feel that may work out the best.
[19:17:17] <Destos> the kind of work*
[19:18:02] <Destos> I enjoy the freelancing lifestyle.
[19:18:15] <percent20> gotcha.
