[10:00:18] <percent20> article wasn't as good as I thought it would be.
[10:01:46] <percent20> it felt like a second or third attempt at writing 2 stories in one so was a bit sloppy.Was good, and glad to hear, for sure, that why is good, but kind of wished _why would have given an exclusive.

[13:42:10] <groovecoder> someone post that on the facebook group?
[13:42:24] <groovecoder> Destos: I use ShiftIt
[13:43:20] <Destos> cool thanks. was without my mouse for a couple hours and decided to try moving around without the trackpad. It was interesting
[13:44:59] <Destos> groovecoder: posted
[13:45:22] <Destos> or not…
[13:47:03] <Destos> ok all appears to be golden now
[13:49:14] <groovecoder> I'll have to see the reactions and discussion on Sunday I guess :)
[13:49:32] <Destos> yes… reactions… :D
[14:42:07] <Destos> percent20: pathfinder!
[14:42:13] <Destos> or totalfinder!
[14:43:08] <percent20> well the oddity is i'll move my mouse and *BAM* finder will all of a sudden move to where the mouse is as if I dragged and dropped it there. Most of the time without me choosing the finder window
[14:43:42] <Destos> that is pretty weird, and you recently installed a bare lion install?
[14:44:05] <percent20> yes
[14:44:11] <percent20> like 2 or 3 weeks ago
[14:44:49] <percent20> heh the look of total finder creeps me out a bit. Though path finder looks interesting.
[14:45:07] <Destos> total finder is what I've been using for a year or so
