[07:03:56] <groovecoder> hah. nice: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI&feature=player_embedded
[09:10:33] <percent2_> groovecoder: I like how they guy with the shaving cream on his head is reading the lean startup
[09:11:49] <groovecoder> hah
[09:11:52] <groovecoder> didn't notice
[09:13:37] <percent2_> glad I am not the only one that thought pedo bear when I saw the bear.
[09:18:08] <percent2_> geh after reading a bit about the new JOBS bill not sure i'd want to use kick starter anymore. http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/08/jobs-act-passes-crowdfunding-bill-startups/
[09:19:01] <percent2_> well not necessarily all of the problems come from the bill, but some of the problems inherit from crowd sourcing funding. http://venturebeat.com/2011/11/08/faq-what-the-new-u-s-crowdfunding-bill-means-for-entrepreneurs/
[09:19:28] <percent2_> the biggest one of note is that each person that puts money in has an amazing amount of power over the rest of the company. :(
[09:20:35] <groovecoder> percent2_: but that's still just an optional mode of crowdfunding right?
[09:20:41] <groovecoder> (the ownership stake part)
[09:21:01] <groovecoder> I mean, you can still do traditional kickstarter mode?
[09:23:24] <percent2_> i don't know. I personally wouldn't want to chance it to have some crazy person decide they want to make my life a living hell because they don't have a job or anything better to do, and their $20 initial investment allows them to do all kinds of crap.
[09:24:41] <percent2_> I dunno I just seem to get stuck with that one guy that makes life miserable. :(
[09:26:25] <Destos> It doesn't look like co-working on scheduled on FaceBook
[09:26:37] <percent2_> gah
[09:26:38] <percent2_> forgot
[09:26:47] <groovecoder> Destos: oops. I'll be up there soon
[09:26:54] <groovecoder> running a couple errands on the way though
[09:26:57] <percent2_> being sick and all really messed my adding it up there.
[09:27:07] <Destos> I'll probably be there from 12-3 then 4-5
[09:27:07] <percent2_> i'll be there too. I am about to head that way.
[09:27:30] <Destos> have to pick up my sister's friend again
[09:27:39] <percent2_> :(
[09:27:53] <percent2_> i'm thinking we need some bus routes on google maps ;)
[09:27:56] <Destos> Did anyone call dan to open up at 10?
[09:27:58] <Destos> we do
[09:28:16] <percent2_> I wasn't aware we were supposed to call.
[09:28:57] <percent2_> its timmorgan
[09:29:21] <timmorgan> I came to coworking
[09:29:24] <timmorgan> but no one here
[09:29:31] <groovecoder> timmorgan: OMW!
[09:29:38] <groovecoder> I gotta see timmorgan at coworking!! :)
[09:29:43] <percent2_> O_O me too
[09:29:54] <percent2_> I was about to head that direction, I need to hurry and leave then.
[09:29:57] <timmorgan> lol
[09:30:06] <percent2_> timmorgan: we have kind of been showing up around 10ish.
[09:30:24] <percent2_> !karma?

[16:02:12] <percent20> ???
[16:02:16] <Destos> yeah
[16:02:19] <Destos> I had a total meltdown
[16:02:22] <Destos> told luke to f off
[16:02:39] <percent20> wow
[16:02:46] <timmorgan> it was nuts
[16:02:58] <percent20> what was the meltdown over?
[16:03:11] <groovecoder> politics
[16:03:30] <percent20> ah. what specifically?
[16:04:17] <groovecoder> Destos said that a $0.02 titanium tax goes too far, and I said a $0.02 titanium tax doesn't go too far enough
[16:05:09] <groovecoder> just kidding, we set some stuff on fire with the laser-cutter
[16:05:18] <percent20> cool.
[16:05:26] <percent20> sounds like an interesting afternoon

[16:06:21] <percent20> groovecoder: you have a daugher right?
