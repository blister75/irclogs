[14:17:26] <SeanW122> anyone awake?
[14:18:34] <SeanW122> Destos, I need to know how to add sponsor images. I need to add Telerik
[14:18:50] <Destos> alright
[14:19:11] <Destos> do you have a nice transparent Telerik logo?
[14:19:23] <Destos> to keep it consistent with the current logos
[14:19:24] <Destos> a png
[14:19:31] <SeanW122> looking for that and the site login url
[14:19:46] <Destos> http://tulsaschoolofdev.com/wp-admin/
[14:20:48] <SeanW122> only have a jpg right now for Telerik
[14:21:05] <Destos> once logged in click on Sponsors in the sidebar
[14:21:16] <Destos> a jpg will be fine
[14:21:40] <Destos> then click add new in the sidebar or at the top of the Sponsors list page
[14:22:14] <SeanW122> ok, Sponsor META?
[14:22:23] <SeanW122> what URL should I use?
[14:22:29] <Destos> their website
[14:22:50] <SeanW122> k, then "set featured image"?
[14:22:50] <Destos> I would think?
[14:22:53] <Destos> yup
[14:22:56] <Destos> then upload the image
[14:23:07] <Destos> after its uploaded you have to scroll down and click set as featured image
[14:24:04] <Destos> once its set as a featured image, just publish it
[14:24:30] <SeanW122> published
[14:24:34] <SeanW122> not on front page yet
[14:24:40] <Destos> looks liked it wasn't set as the featured image
[14:24:48] <SeanW122> hmm, ok, redoing
[14:25:02] <Destos> after clicking set featured image
[14:25:04] <Destos> click media
[14:25:14] <Destos> or rather the gallery tab
[14:25:49] <Destos> then scroll down to the bottom of the image's info and there should be a set as featured image link
[14:26:01] <Destos> after clicking that you can close it and it should be set
[14:26:19] <SeanW122> ;) telerik is on
[14:27:09] <SeanW122> i messed up the link
[14:28:46] <SeanW122> fixed
[14:28:47] <SeanW122> thanks
[14:30:56] <SeanW122> how do I add speakers?
[14:31:20] <Destos> add a new author
[14:31:44] <SeanW122> I dont' see authors
[14:34:02] <Destos> go to users in the nab bar and then add new
[14:34:38] <SeanW122> ah ok, then the Role is Author?
[14:34:51] <Destos> yeah you can try that, I added a role Speaker as well
[14:34:57] <Destos> but it hasn't been thoroughly tested
[14:35:11] <Destos> speaker should only allow them to login and edit their own talks
[14:39:59] <SeanW122> k, I'll just add them and not give out there login info.
[14:40:13] <Destos> sounds good
[14:40:31] <SeanW122> Sweet, just got Manning.com to give us books too!  woot!
[14:40:36] <Destos> when you add a new talk you just have to switch the author at the bottom of the edit page
[14:40:47] <SeanW122> got it, thanks
[14:41:31] <Destos> also when adding a new speaker go to their user page and set their display name to their full name
[14:41:42] <SeanW122> ok
[14:41:43] <Destos> wordpress by default uses their username
[14:41:47] <Destos> which is fairly annoying
[14:41:59] <Destos> user page = user edit page
[14:42:15] <SeanW122> ok
[15:15:17] <percent20> wow my blog is really making the rounds in china.
[15:16:06] <SeanW122> prob translated badly
[19:28:40] <percent20> yay me. I got stuff working the way I want it to.
[19:44:08] <SeanW122> woot
