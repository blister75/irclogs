[13:14:07] <percent2_> I just saw a google street view car.
[13:14:49] <percent2_> when i first saw it a distance i thought "WTF is that thing."
[13:17:20] <danf1> Ha... That car captured me and my son walking down my street in BA several years ago. I need to see if that image is still live. :-)
[13:17:52] <percent2_> how long does it take for images to show up on the site?
[13:18:31] <danf1> I don't remember exactly, but I think it was 2-3 months. That was the first time Street View came through the Tulsa area, back in early 2008.
[13:18:43] <percent2_> ah
[13:20:26] <danf1> Here we are. He was almost 3 at the time. Now he's 7. https://skitch.com/danf/8p82d/streetview
[13:21:02] <danf1> When they first posted it, we hadn't been blurred out.
[13:50:16] <mrmakeit> so there invading Tulsa today?
[14:01:45] <percent2_> i saw them in Sapulpa
[14:24:18] <groovecoder> they caught my brother and I outside brewing beer after the ice-storm, so it looks like the house has a stockade out front. http://screencast.com/t/EzJt5GFFhp
[14:24:47] <percent2_> LOL
[14:26:12] <percent2_> groovecoder: do you know what "managers" are in Django?
[14:30:46] <groovecoder> in the orm?
[14:31:12] <groovecoder> they're the class responsible for doing all the data binding and querying and such
[14:36:07] <percent2_> okay. I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. I got an email asking me to do something on managers. Thought it was a bit of an odd topic compared to the rest of my requests.
[14:44:07] <percent2_> oh godjango has made me $20.00 :D someone clicked on my linode hosting link and got hosting for 3 months so I got referal fee of $20 :D
[14:59:16] <Destos> wewt
[15:06:21] <mrmakeit> destos: your a google guy, right?  you know if a schedual exists for the street view van?
[15:06:57] <Destos> yes I work at google
[15:08:02] <Destos> I've heard of people setting up for a google street view passing so I imagine there is
[15:28:59] <percent2_> Destos: awesome can we get a tour of google in pryor?
[16:32:47] <danf1> percent2_: That was probably me that got you the referral fee at Linode. A while back you were talking about it, so I sent your link to our sysadmin, and he used it. Don't spend it all in one place!
[16:54:10] <percent2_> thanks man. :D unfortunatly i'll have to spend it all in one place it'll help with one month of hosting :)
[16:54:16] <percent2_> thanks.
