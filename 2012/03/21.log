[17:28:42] <percent2_> that was well edited
[17:28:57] <percent2_> I unfortunately decided to read a few comments, and promptly lost faith in humanity, again.
[17:29:18] <Destos> I don't think I have ever attempted to read youtube comments
[17:29:25] <Destos> litterally
[17:29:52] <Destos> a kitten run ran up and started chewing on my ear… :/
[17:31:07] <percent2_> lol. You can try to make a cat stew.
[17:32:09] <Destos> I don't think I want to try that
[17:32:40] <percent2_> i would try and find a recipe for a joke, but I don't think I want to search for it.
[17:32:50] <percent2_> i'm afraid I might actually get results.
[17:34:47] <Destos> you will
[17:37:13] <percent2_> So what does cat stew taste like?

[17:47:25] <percent2_> true.
[17:48:09] <Destos> whoa, latest version of firefox centers images and sets the bg to a dark grey.
