[09:51:12] <percent20> jwhitlock: not really
[09:56:00] <jwhitlock> when you sign up for brigade CfA, set your city:  http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/users?utf8=âœ“&query=Tulsa%2C+OK

[10:34:52] <percent20> the test has succeeded
[10:35:00] <mrmakeit> lol
[10:35:42] <mrmakeit> so where is the cake?
[10:36:12] <percent20> the cake is a lie.
[10:36:34] <jwhitlock> http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt
[10:40:07] <MattGalloway> So is there a way in CSS that I can change the background of text (like a highlighter) but not of the whitespace in between the text?
[10:41:37] <groovecoder> Destos: ^
[10:42:05] <percent20> MattGalloway: I would assume yes.
[10:42:48] <MattGalloway> percent20: As helpful as that answer may seem, do you have any idea HOW?!?!?!?
[10:42:54] <Destos> not without a lot of spans wrapping all the text
[10:43:15] <MattGalloway> Destos: Yeah, that's what I thought. Thanks.
[10:43:49] <Destos> there might be a way with some vendor prefixes
[10:45:04] <MattGalloway> Destos: Naw, that sounds like WAY more work than this project warrens. I can find another way to make the text stand out.
[10:45:29] <MattGalloway> s/warrens/warrants/
[10:52:32] <jwhitlock> jgmize: what do I need? ImportError: No module named apiclient.discovery
[10:52:45] <jwhitlock> jsatt: wake jgmize up
[10:53:04] <jwhitlock> Destos: punch jgmize plz
[10:53:40] <MattGalloway> jwhitlock: Duh. You need a module names apiclient.discovery
[10:54:12] <MattGalloway> s/names/named/ Damn these fingers. I'm so much funnier without the type-o's.
[10:55:46] <jwhitlock> actually, it's "google-api-python-client"
[14:23:43] <MattGalloway> groovecoder: Talked to an library IT person today about the Hackathon app. I took the opportunity to ask about ssh access over wifi at Hardesty. She said she's gonna check in to it and let me know.
[14:24:07] <percent20> anyone see buddylindsey.com as a result for this? https://www.google.com/search?q=irssi+on+windows&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-nightly&channel=fflb
[14:26:52] <MattGalloway> percent20: I get it as the 5th result on the first page.
[14:26:55] <X_A> This is what I hacked together:  http://www.gobobpipe.com/corral/2.html
[14:27:10] <percent20> MattGalloway: thank you :D

[14:31:45] <MattGalloway> Who is X_A?
[14:32:32] <MattGalloway> X_A: That's really cool.
[14:35:01] <X_A> MattGalloway: Yea, I'm a total thief though :)  Demo or otherwise, I was just trying to prove a concept at some point.  Course, I'm too much of a designer to make it work lol
[14:35:13] <X_A> *stares hard at 2,000 of code*
[14:35:34] <MattGalloway> X_A WHo are you?
[14:35:48] <X_A> Saif Khan, sorry XA is default IRC logic to me heh
[14:35:54] <MattGalloway> I hate IRC nicks. ;)
[14:36:10] <SaifKhan> heh
[14:36:12] <MattGalloway> AAAAAhhhhh. Hey Saif!
[14:36:20] <SaifKhan> I used to spend a lot of time on EFnet for #SoulCalibur
[14:36:25] <SaifKhan> hahah - yea sup!
[14:36:35] <SaifKhan> I don't have a IRC client, and thus am rarely in here
[14:36:38] <SaifKhan> will probably be here now more
[14:36:45] <SaifKhan> Wow, bad english.
[14:37:54] <MattGalloway> My iPad app for architects has a bubble diagram feature that people love. One day I hope to implement it as a web app and your little hack reminded me of that - it works just like my iPad app - simple moving of boxes.
[14:43:02] <SaifKhan> Ahh, yea I figured you'd have already mastered this sort of problem.  Seems like there'd be more of this in demos / etc...  Seems like a real key tool for helping HTML5 prolificate.
[14:49:13] <SaifKhan> MattGalloway: Speaking of your app, didn't that already launch, or no?
[14:49:39] <SaifKhan> I don't really run in any architect circles, so I haven't had a chance to suggest it yet :)
