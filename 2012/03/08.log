[09:09:50] <danf1> Yesterday, I used the "Report a problem" link in Google Maps and told them about the bad handling of TCC NE campus. Now, when you search for "3727 East Apache Street Tulsa, Oklahoma," it at least takes you to the right place. If you click on the TCC link, though, it still shows the west campus address.
