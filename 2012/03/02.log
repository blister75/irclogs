[09:03:25] <groovecoder> percent20: WebTelephony and WebSMS look niiiiice. var tel = navigator.mozTelephony; var call = tel.dial("123456789"); call.hangUp();
[09:04:09] <groovecoder> var sms = navigator.mozSMS; sms.send("123456789", "Hello!");
[10:10:20] <zerokarmaleft> https://github.com/tulsawebdevs/ircbot/issues/15 <= heh, superfluous AND essential
[10:30:36] <Destos> uno-working is fun
[10:31:14] <groovecoder> Destos: heh, you at Fab Lab?
[10:31:17] <groovecoder> is it open already?
[10:31:32] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: ;)
[10:31:56] <Destos> indeed
[10:32:40] <groovecoder> Destos: will you be there a while? I might swing by on my way out of town later
[10:32:59] <groovecoder> though "on my way" would actually be 20+ miles OUT of my way :(
[10:33:06] <Destos> Probably, if I'm the only one for a long time I duno how long I'll stay
[10:34:07] <groovecoder> it's weird not watching our facebook events for RSVP counts :)
[10:34:32] <groovecoder> getting a glimpse of how our group can go so unknown for anyone who isn't on the facebook group
[10:59:09] <groovecoder> Destos: I'll meet up with you another time. 20+ miles out of my way is too discouraging :)
[10:59:18] <groovecoder> hope you aren't lonely at the lab all day
[11:24:52] <Destos> so how does one apply a patch file :/
[11:28:59] <Destos> mat patching
[11:29:02] <Destos> man*
[11:30:50] <sephillips> any coworkers today? anyone doing lunch?
[11:32:23] <Destos> I'm the only one here so far.
[11:32:31] <Destos> brought Pizza :)
[11:35:24] <percent20> geh, now I think I am getting a normal cold/bronchidas
[12:07:33] <groovecoder> Destos: usually `patch -p 0 < file.patch`
[12:07:37] <groovecoder> -p0
[12:21:49] <jgmize> Jeremy and I are heading to the fab lab for lunch
