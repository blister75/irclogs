[14:16:54] <jwhitlock> I am the worst pairing partner
[14:17:10] <jwhitlock> I am doing a horrible job of keeping jgmize on task.
[14:17:30] <jwhitlock> Also, I only seem to do IRC when I'm at the Fab Lab

[20:07:42] <percent20> groovecoder: you around?
[20:43:59] <groovecoder> percent20: am now
[20:44:30] <percent20> I have a dependency issue.
[20:44:33] <percent20> with my models.
[20:44:36] <groovecoder> oh?
[20:45:03] <percent20> I have an event app and a department app
[20:45:51] <percent20> if the department app is in INSTALLED_APPS after event i can't reference the department model in events.
[20:46:21] <percent20> however, I have a slot model in events which is referenced in deparment so it needs to be before deparment app
[20:47:13] <percent20> any thoughts on how to resolve a circular dependency like that?
[20:55:40] <percent20> while the same problem exists I have a differen solution
[22:10:40] <groovecoder> percent20: wow, I suck. just did a bunch of "open source software in government" research on Google for Tom and I completely ignored IRC this whole time ><
[22:11:21] <groovecoder> percent20: I'd say since they all depend on each other that's cause enough to put them all in the same app
[22:14:51] <percent20> its that whole "are you there? 'yes in an hour ill talk again'" situation.
[22:14:52] <percent20> heh
