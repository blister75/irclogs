[08:34:29] <jwhitlock> I'm much happier with #tulsawebdevs after settings /ignore tulsabot_
[08:34:50] <jwhitlock> But, I don't know how to unignore, so I can't screw with them anymore :(
[08:35:17] <tulsabot_node> Your http://turntable.fm/tulsawebdevs recap
[08:35:20] <Destos> so sad
[08:35:29] <zerokarmaleft> jwhitlock: indeed
[08:37:09] <jwhitlock> ah  - '/ignore' opens ignore list.  LimeChat hides it in the Server Properties
[08:38:28] <zerokarmaleft> i guess i could submit a patch to make it less annoying
[08:46:25] <jwhitlock> There are a lot of options - I can ignore by content of message for instance
[08:47:17] <jwhitlock> I think the bot is OK for the folks that want the info, and the rest can ignore or /ignore
[08:49:02] <Destos> doing it up if anyone wants to join

[14:18:21] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: eh?
[14:18:34] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: it's on the whiteboard here at fab lab
[14:18:40] <groovecoder> w/ percent20 and I
[14:18:45] <zerokarmaleft> heh
[14:19:12] <zerokarmaleft> put a DNE at the bottom and i might be able to get there on monday :P
[14:19:24] <zerokarmaleft> send me a picture, i guess?
[14:19:31] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: you have to sign an NDA :)
[14:20:19] <zerokarmaleft> ah, future ridiculously overvalued IPO at stake eh? :D
[14:21:21] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: it's not that complex. build a better data-powered caniuse.com 1. stand up a graphite + statsd server at something like willitwork.com 2. add code to modernizr to post user-agent/feature:1|0 to the server 3. create tables of user-agent/feature support data
[14:22:28] <jwhitlock> percent20: you are making me question my 'always upvote on tulsawebdevs turntable' strategy
[14:22:54] <percent20> hahaha what don't you like about this? its awesome.

[14:24:14] <tulsabot_node> jwhitlock has -11 awesome points.
[14:27:25] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: when do you gather data for a specific browser instance?
[14:28:50] <percent20> garrrr linux is driving me nuts as I adjust to it.
[14:29:03] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: you/we add code to modernizr when it does its if (Modernizr.canvas) check
[14:29:34] <zerokarmaleft> no i get that, what's the user story
[14:30:15] <zerokarmaleft> they visit willitwork.com and modernizr digs for features and appends to the dataset?
[14:32:03] <percent20> it keeps the site more up-to-date on working "stuff" in browsers instead of digging through dev docs.
[14:32:27] <percent20> zerokarmaleft, as my understanding yes.
