[19:45:06] <percent20> bad thing about a public turntable.fm is exactly what has happened now. Group of people invading the thing and playing crappy music.
[19:49:51] <percent20> lol they know how to manipulate the dj table queue so the original people in the room can't play anything
[20:17:05] <Destos> i don't see anyone but you in there..
[20:17:20] <percent20> i out waited them.
[20:17:29] <percent20> once they saw no one being outraged they left
[20:17:39] <percent20> kind of the ignore a bully and they go away thing.
[20:17:44] <Destos> heh
[20:17:55] <Destos> how was your day buddy?
[20:18:25] <percent20> been okay, but now that I have been able to sit down and do work its gotten better.
[20:18:57] <Destos> thats nice, I've been pretty much diving into backbone for the past couple days so that's been fun
[20:19:01] <percent20> almost ready to deploy some code and work on an automated deploy for a site. Am even thinking about trying to do a continuous deployment thing.
[20:19:11] <Destos> gone be able to show ya guys in a week or som what I've been working on
[20:19:18] <percent20> nice. you gonna be the Tulsa expert on backbone :)
[20:19:31] <Destos> ha, Tim may be beating me not sure though
[20:19:33] <percent20> can't wait to see it.
[20:19:42] <percent20> well, he is doing php now. heh
[20:19:49] <Destos> poor Tim :(
[20:20:14] <percent20> yeah.
[20:20:48] <Destos> also, the thing I've been working on is a responsive layout that utilizes backbone :o
[20:20:53] <Destos> so its been extra fun
[20:21:29] <percent20> very nice.
[20:21:43] <percent20> I am still fighting myself on making a game engine.
[20:21:55] <percent20> am hoping if I ignore the urge long enough it will go away.
[20:22:51] <Destos> :(
[20:22:57] <Destos> don't fight the urge!
[20:23:45] <Destos> just imagine, you can't respond to this question with 'yes': 'so buddy have you ever programed a javascript game engine?'
[20:24:20] <percent20> lol.
[20:25:03] <percent20> lol I have been fighting a test for 10 minutes only to realize the test was passing. It was another test that wasn't passing.
[20:32:00] <Destos> :(
[20:32:29] <percent20> phew maybe another hour of minor tweaks and I am ready to deploy
[20:35:10] <Destos> west, gone head out for now, probably go see Madagascar with da wife
[20:35:14] <Destos> wewt*
