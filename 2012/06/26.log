[10:43:26] <djmakeit> is there a hackathon this weekend?
[10:44:38] <groovecoder> djmakeit: no :(
[10:45:39] <djmakeit> Dan says there is a listing on the fab lab calender
[10:46:07] <zerokarmaleft> probably, it got cancelled though
[10:47:25] <groovecoder> djmakeit: oh yeah, tell them they can remove that
[10:51:06] <djmakeit> did
[10:53:17] <zerokarmaleft> anybody interested in doing a group TDD code kata session at a future meeting?
[10:58:53] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: yeah. ask in facebook too though
[11:00:48] <tulsabot_node> Your http://turntable.fm/tulsawebdevs recap
[11:19:56] <zerokarmaleft> man, i hate that i can't edit Facebook posts to fix typos ><
[11:53:15] <djmakeit> groovecoder: can you access browserid through a different service from the one you sign up with?
[11:54:04] <groovecoder> djmakeit: I don't understand the q
[11:54:25] <groovecoder> specific example?
[11:54:39] <djmakeit> example I sign up with Mozilla, then on a different comp use my service to get the key.
[11:55:01] <djmakeit> *another service
[11:55:43] <groovecoder> djmakeit: so you register djmakeit@djmakeit.com at browserid.org, then you run your own service and register djmakeit@djmakeit.com on that service?
[11:56:06] <djmakeit> yes
[11:56:45] <groovecoder> in theory, that should work but I've not seen an example of it. it's just a fancy verified email protocol
[11:57:20] <groovecoder> whichever service you use to verify your email address, you'll get a token that says "Yes, this client actually owns and controls djmakeit@djmakeit.com"
[11:57:47] <groovecoder> and you send that token to the relying party site and they verify its validity
[11:58:00] <djmakeit> is the token the same from any service?
[11:58:16] <groovecoder> that I'm not sure about, but I imagine so.
[11:58:25] <groovecoder> otherwise it wouldn't validate?
[11:58:35] <groovecoder> but you'd have to try it to be sure.
[11:58:49] <groovecoder> and submit bugs if it doesn't work the way you expect ;)
[11:59:03] <djmakeit> I'm thinking what if a service you verify goes down
[11:59:20] <djmakeit> *with
[11:59:38] <groovecoder> if you still have your token it shouldn't matter
[12:00:12] <djmakeit> what if you lose your token?
[12:00:33] <groovecoder> you have to generate a new one, which would require a service
[12:01:25] <NetMakeIt> and you would be able to login to sites with that token, as the same user?
[12:02:10] <NetMakeIt> and if the tokens are the same, whos to say you couldnt just generate a token yourself of someone else?
[12:02:46] <groovecoder> to properly generate someone else's token, you have to have control of their email address
[12:02:59] <groovecoder> that's baked into the protocol
[12:03:42] <groovecoder> NetMakeIt: djmakeit: you should really be asking this stuff in #identity on irc.mozilla.org :)
[12:03:52] <NetMakeIt> good idea.
[12:05:23] <NetMakeIt> does anyone here know keith sparks? from tulsa opensource hardware?
