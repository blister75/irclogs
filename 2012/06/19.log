[14:40:01] <groovecoder> hey all, sorry I didn't get to broadcast my OKC.js talk today :(
[14:40:26] <groovecoder> I was running out of time even putting it all together so I never asked them to set up the ustream. :( I'll make a screencast out of it
[14:43:09] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: what was the title of the talk?
[14:43:24] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: http://okcjs.com/blog/2012/06/18/meeting-june-19-final-fox-the-future-of-the-web/
[14:47:51] <zerokarmaleft> a talk like that needs to last at least 120 hours and have a built-in trading card game
[14:48:41] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: good point

[16:48:24] <percent20> groovecoder: did Mozilla do their own custom game engine for browserquest or did they use another one?
[16:54:37] <groovecoder> percent20: made their own, but I think a lot of it is now part of gladius and/or paladin?
[16:56:16] <percent20> groovecoder: okay. I was looking at gladius and it seems to just be a 3d engine
[16:56:48] <groovecoder> percent20: maybe ... check https://wiki.mozilla.org/Paladin to see if the 2d part has been "liberated"
