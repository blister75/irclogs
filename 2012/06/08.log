[08:36:15] <keith__> hallo
[08:39:51] <groovecoder> keith__: yo
[08:40:04] <keith__> magic
[08:40:13] <groovecoder> keith__: how's GuRuStu ?
[08:40:22] <keith__> lovely'
[08:40:27] <keith__> i enjoy air conditioning
[08:40:34] <groovecoder> isn't Adam over there? ask him why he's never in IRC. ;)
[08:40:51] <keith__> he is camping today
[08:41:14] <keith__> do you know things about wordpress
[08:42:26] <groovecoder> keith__: a little. but Destos is the resident WordPress expert
[08:42:35] <groovecoder> also Carlos, Saif, and/or Trisha, but they're never on IRC
[08:42:44] <keith__> haha ok
[08:53:09] <Destos> what is this WordPress
[08:53:12] <Destos> you speak of
[08:53:21] <keith__> lol
[08:53:33] <keith__> i can't seem to figure out how to reference images
[08:53:42] <keith__> from the "images" folder
[08:53:44] <keith__> in my theme
[08:54:27] <Destos> just a FYI I used to work at gurustu, so I'm conflicted on whether or not I should help you
[08:54:44] <Destos> >:D
[08:54:50] <keith__> lol
[08:55:26] <Destos> say happy belated b-day to carlos forme
[08:55:26] <keith__> I'm switching from rails, so I'm ending up smashing my face on every little thing… its super fun
[08:55:35] <keith__> will do
[08:55:36] <Destos> yeah… that sounds like fun
[08:55:51] <keith__> ill go with that word you used
[08:55:52] <keith__> fun.
[08:55:55] <Destos> so are you trying to ref them within CSS?
[08:56:09] <Destos> or insert them into the html
[08:56:21] <keith__> i was just playing with it using html
[08:56:28] <keith__> I'm just trying to throw a logo in the header currently
[08:56:53] <Destos> do if via CSS
[08:56:54] <keith__> i actually got the background image to show up in the application.scss file
[08:56:56] <keith__> ok
[08:57:21] <Destos> the logo should be replacing what is in the header h1 if there is any
[08:57:30] <Destos> the only images in your hmtl should be related to content
[08:57:36] <Destos> so posts or pages
[08:57:37] <keith__> ok
[08:57:41] <keith__> right that makes sense
[08:58:17] <Destos> so some advice, don't get personal with stu, he'll treat you better if you aren't chummy. He walks over you less.
[08:58:36] <keith__> alright
[08:58:54] <keith__> he seems to be gone most of the time
[08:59:37] <Destos> lucky
[09:00:14] <percent20> so install linux on mac os x lion == (damn near impossible || way to long and complicated to be worth it)
[09:03:16] <groovecoder> percent20: umm ... what? how does one even install "linux on mac os x lion" ?
[09:03:25] <keith__> voodoo
[09:03:57] <percent20> well maybe not on, but along side.
[09:04:11] <percent20> or even supplementary to OS X.
[09:04:41] <groovecoder> percent20: ah. like Microsoft's "Genuine Software Only"™ crap ?
[09:04:47] <groovecoder> (afk a bit)
[09:05:04] <percent20> no more like apple requires you to install Windows 7 only with bootcamp
[09:05:20] <percent20> then you have to overwrite windows with linux later.
[09:06:30] <Destos> percent20: there are probably easier ways?
[09:06:45] <Destos> maybe duck duck go sucks for searching OSX related questions?!?!? :P
[09:07:03] <percent20> heh have been swaping between it and google.
[10:46:10] <jgmize> anyone over there at the fab lab have lunch plans? the CA crew is planning on heading down there soon
[10:48:23] <percent20> groovecoder1: http://www.billboard.com/photos/stylus/501850-nicki-minaj-cover-617-409.jpg
[10:48:53] <groovecoder> jgmize: Cancun sound good?
[10:49:25] <jgmize> sounds good to us, we'll just stop on the way to get cash
[10:49:34] <jgmize> see you soon

[13:44:02] <keith__> anyone watching the euros?
[13:50:31] <groovecoder> keith__: I watched a little of POL v. GRE
[13:54:33] <keith__> yeah i was at lunch so got to see some of that match
[13:54:50] <keith__> i think the pk was pretty harsh, it didn't look like he had any chance of scoring after the first touch
[13:54:55] <keith__> was a really bad touch

[21:43:28] <DJMakeIt> percent20: I'm liking less and less the idea of trying to push logs to github.
[21:44:47] <DJMakeIt> it looks like i'd either have to access the git client, or try to interface with the github api.  neither sound fun.

[23:17:50] <groovecoder> DJMakeIt: https://github.com/ajaxorg/node-github for accessing github api from node ?
[23:18:21] <DJMakeIt> ya. tried that. but started getting really messy.
[23:18:37] <DJMakeIt> trying a mongoDB now
[23:19:07] <DJMakeIt> seems alot easyer
[23:19:50] <DJMakeIt> and i clearly need to learn to spell.
[23:20:04] <DJMakeIt> or to not try typing at 12 at night
[23:21:36] <DJMakeIt> !listen
[23:21:44] <DJMakeIt> !dj
[23:21:58] <DJMakeIt> yay cross connection. And logging!
[23:22:48] <DJMakeIt> think i'll call it a night
[23:24:04] <percent20> woohoo my password wasn't one of the ones gotten from linked in
[23:28:17] <DJMakeIt> percent20: would it be a bad idea to move the irc logs to a mongo database?
[23:28:38] <percent20> DJMakeIt: yes, because they are on github.
[23:28:49] <percent20> heh I just want them to endup in the github repo
[23:29:17] <percent20> we could write a cron job on my server to pull from mongodb and submit a log to github
[23:29:36] <DJMakeIt> maybe.  but why not just host them from the node?
[23:29:42] <DJMakeIt> *app
[23:30:06] <percent20> because i want to browse them on github.
[23:30:30] <DJMakeIt> alright i guess you could do that
[23:30:49] <DJMakeIt> but i figured since we were moving the karma to mongo
[23:30:52] <DJMakeIt> ...
[23:31:05] <percent20> The entire reason for the bot in the first place was to put logs on github.
[23:31:11] <DJMakeIt> right.
[23:31:24] <percent20> we can do both that way we can query the mongo db for log entries.
[23:31:33] <percent20> maybe do some analytics as well on our conversation history.
[23:31:53] <DJMakeIt> there you go.
[23:31:58] <DJMakeIt> good idea.
[23:32:37] <DJMakeIt> i have it currently set up with logs taged with a year, month, day, and the time of the action.
[23:32:56] <DJMakeIt> so pulling to a log file shouldn't be hard
[23:33:05] <percent20> okay.
[23:33:53] <DJMakeIt> also, were you leaving the file open as you wrote to it?
[23:34:06] <DJMakeIt> or did you close after each write?
[23:35:05] <percent20> I think I was closing it.
[23:35:56] <percent20> it automatically closes it when the block ends.
[23:35:59] <DJMakeIt> k.  sent you a pull request.
[23:36:48] <DJMakeIt> closing.  alright.
[23:39:08] <DJMakeIt> now we'll see just how long this last.
[23:40:23] <percent20> !hello
[23:40:24] <tulsabot_test> こんにちはpercent20お元気ですか。時間は5:40:23 am
[23:40:55] <DJMakeIt> i wonder if jitsu is on a different time zone?
[23:41:19] <DJMakeIt> nvm, it's UTC
[23:41:20] <percent20> they might be GMT
[23:41:23] <percent20> or that.
[23:42:19] <DJMakeIt> remind me to check and see if moment/nodejitsu has an easy way to change time zones
[23:42:20] <percent20> I'll checkout your code tomorrow and do some testing.
[23:42:34] <DJMakeIt> k. sound cool. see you later
[23:42:46] <DJMakeIt> should i leave it running?
[23:43:36] <percent20> DJMakeIt: yeah leave it running just to see how it does.
[23:43:56] <DJMakeIt> k.  also what do we do about the db password?
[23:43:58] <percent20> also moment.js does do timezone with the stringformat.
[23:44:15] <percent20> that was one of the things I was going to mess with when I did some testing of it tomorrow.
[23:44:23] <DJMakeIt> k.
[23:46:03] <DJMakeIt> what's a good e-mail address to reach you at?
[23:46:21] <DJMakeIt> I'll send you the nodejitsu db stuff.
[23:46:55] <DJMakeIt> correction: mongolab's
[23:47:05] <percent20> buddy at buddylindsey dot com
[23:47:10] <DJMakeIt> got it
[23:48:31] <groovecoder> DJMakeIt: mongolab? why not mongohq?
[23:48:45] <groovecoder> mongohq is run by a former Tulsa Web Dev
[23:49:13] <DJMakeIt> well, cause i hadn't heard of mongohq, and buddy told me about mongolab
[23:50:15] <DJMakeIt> and i'll probably not use either in the end and just use nodejitsu's db's.
[23:50:27] <percent20> groovecoder: I use mongolab
[23:50:46] <groovecoder> DJMakeIt: ok. we have free credit w/ mongohq though if you ever hit the free cap on either nodejitsu or mongolab
[23:51:01] <DJMakeIt> sound good to me.
[23:52:12] <DJMakeIt> for testing i don't think we'll hit the 250 mb limit
[23:52:34] <groovecoder> bah, I can't remember the mongohq username/pw anyway :(
[23:52:36] <percent20> in production I don't think we'll hit 250 mb limit. That is a LOT of data.
[23:53:40] <DJMakeIt> idk, the current db is 3kb with just 5 entries.
[23:55:06] <DJMakeIt> nvm, i cant figure out the statistics on this site.  one says 16mb and one says 7 kb
[23:55:33] <percent20> yeah. I am curios do they charge for the big one or the actual data
[23:56:18] <percent20> I have 3003 records hitting 48 meg for the total file size.
[23:56:24] <percent20> for my twitter images app.
[23:56:24] <DJMakeIt> all i see is file size 16mb and data 7kb. and how do you get a 16mb file from 7 kb of data?
[23:56:39] <percent20> not sure. might be indexing and stuff.
[23:57:11] <DJMakeIt> i read some where about buffers to keep updates nice.
[23:57:43] <DJMakeIt> still cant see adding 10000x data for either.
[23:58:26] <percent20> heh. yeah not that worried.
[23:59:45] <DJMakeIt> *facepalm* "
[23:59:48] <DJMakeIt>               The first file allocated is 16MB, the second 32MB, the third 64MB ... until 512MB
[23:59:50] <DJMakeIt>               is reached at which point each subsequent file is 512MB.
[23:59:52] <DJMakeIt>             "
