[08:36:15] <keith__> hallo
[08:39:51] <groovecoder> keith__: yo
[08:40:04] <keith__> magic
[08:40:13] <groovecoder> keith__: how's GuRuStu ?
[08:40:22] <keith__> lovely'
[08:40:27] <keith__> i enjoy air conditioning
[08:40:34] <groovecoder> isn't Adam over there? ask him why he's never in IRC. ;)
[08:40:51] <keith__> he is camping today
[08:41:14] <keith__> do you know things about wordpress
[08:42:26] <groovecoder> keith__: a little. but Destos is the resident WordPress expert
[08:42:35] <groovecoder> also Carlos, Saif, and/or Trisha, but they're never on IRC
[08:42:44] <keith__> haha ok
[08:53:09] <Destos> what is this WordPress
[08:53:12] <Destos> you speak of
[08:53:21] <keith__> lol
[08:53:33] <keith__> i can't seem to figure out how to reference images
[08:53:42] <keith__> from the "images" folder
[08:53:44] <keith__> in my theme
[08:54:27] <Destos> just a FYI I used to work at gurustu, so I'm conflicted on whether or not I should help you
[08:54:44] <Destos> >:D
[08:54:50] <keith__> lol
[08:55:26] <Destos> say happy belated b-day to carlos forme
[08:55:26] <keith__> I'm switching from rails, so I'm ending up smashing my face on every little thing… its super fun
[08:55:35] <keith__> will do
[08:55:36] <Destos> yeah… that sounds like fun
[08:55:51] <keith__> ill go with that word you used
[08:55:52] <keith__> fun.
[08:55:55] <Destos> so are you trying to ref them within CSS?
[08:56:09] <Destos> or insert them into the html
[08:56:21] <keith__> i was just playing with it using html
[08:56:28] <keith__> I'm just trying to throw a logo in the header currently
[08:56:53] <Destos> do if via CSS
[08:56:54] <keith__> i actually got the background image to show up in the application.scss file
[08:56:56] <keith__> ok
[08:57:21] <Destos> the logo should be replacing what is in the header h1 if there is any
[08:57:30] <Destos> the only images in your hmtl should be related to content
[08:57:36] <Destos> so posts or pages
[08:57:37] <keith__> ok
[08:57:41] <keith__> right that makes sense
[08:58:17] <Destos> so some advice, don't get personal with stu, he'll treat you better if you aren't chummy. He walks over you less.
[08:58:36] <keith__> alright
[08:58:54] <keith__> he seems to be gone most of the time
[08:59:37] <Destos> lucky
[09:00:14] <percent20> so install linux on mac os x lion == (damn near impossible || way to long and complicated to be worth it)
[09:03:16] <groovecoder> percent20: umm ... what? how does one even install "linux on mac os x lion" ?
[09:03:25] <keith__> voodoo
[09:03:57] <percent20> well maybe not on, but along side.
[09:04:11] <percent20> or even supplementary to OS X.
[09:04:41] <groovecoder> percent20: ah. like Microsoft's "Genuine Software Only"™ crap ?
[09:04:47] <groovecoder> (afk a bit)
[09:05:04] <percent20> no more like apple requires you to install Windows 7 only with bootcamp
[09:05:20] <percent20> then you have to overwrite windows with linux later.
[09:06:30] <Destos> percent20: there are probably easier ways?
[09:06:45] <Destos> maybe duck duck go sucks for searching OSX related questions?!?!? :P
[09:07:03] <percent20> heh have been swaping between it and google.
[10:46:10] <jgmize> anyone over there at the fab lab have lunch plans? the CA crew is planning on heading down there soon

[10:48:53] <groovecoder> jgmize: Cancun sound good?
[10:49:25] <jgmize> sounds good to us, we'll just stop on the way to get cash
[10:49:34] <jgmize> see you soon

[13:44:02] <keith__> anyone watching the euros?
[13:50:31] <groovecoder> keith__: I watched a little of POL v. GRE
[13:54:33] <keith__> yeah i was at lunch so got to see some of that match
[13:54:50] <keith__> i think the pk was pretty harsh, it didn't look like he had any chance of scoring after the first touch
[13:54:55] <keith__> was a really bad touch

[21:43:28] <DJMakeIt> percent20: I'm liking less and less the idea of trying to push logs to github.
[21:44:47] <DJMakeIt> it looks like i'd either have to access the git client, or try to interface with the github api.  neither sound fun.
