[07:26:11] <zerokarmaleft> http://www.census.gov/developers/
[07:30:50] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: yeah, federal agencies are rocking the open data
[07:31:23] <zerokarmaleft> has al gore tried to take all the credit yet?
[07:41:15] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: do you ever do any remote pairing?
[07:41:29] <groovecoder> rarely
[07:41:47] <groovecoder> we mostly do peer/code reviews in the form of github PR's
[07:42:00] <groovecoder> why?
[07:42:26] <zerokarmaleft> just curious what you use when you have to pair remotely? e.g. screen/tmux or something else entirely
[07:54:59] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: also, i'm curious about seeing if we could do something like seajure's swarm-coding at one of our meetings
[08:02:40] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: when I do it at all, I usually just do screen + vim
[08:03:17] <zerokarmaleft> that's basically what swarm-coding is, just taken to the next step
[08:03:38] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: that sounds awesome
[08:03:48] <zerokarmaleft> a shared tmux session, and mix between structured and chaotic collaborative hacking
[08:04:19] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: do you want to do swarm-coding at June meeting? you can take the last smaller room for it
[08:04:47] <groovecoder> so far we have Productive Programmer & Freelance Tools tech talks going on
[08:05:00] <groovecoder> but i2E has 3 spaces we can use
[08:05:03] <zerokarmaleft> i have summer classes that overlap with the meeting time unfortunately
[08:05:17] <zerokarmaleft> so i can only show up for the last 20-30 mins
[08:05:23] <groovecoder> well that sucks. so we won't see you at a meeting for a while? :(
[08:06:28] <zerokarmaleft> the class gets out at 7:20 on mondays, but so far it's ended early
[08:06:46] <zerokarmaleft> i should at least be able to poke my head
[08:06:54] <zerokarmaleft> in*
[08:09:14] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: i could do some more research and maybe run a short tooling workshop at the next meeting
[08:09:56] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: yeah that'd be cool. it may also make a good blog post or something. as we start doing multiple topics/talks at each meeting, we'll have to see how much people are torn between them
[10:42:53] <percent2_> http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/06/07/meet-the-new-windows-azure.aspx
[11:32:15] <percent20_> *sigh* i am downtown now for a few hours. :(
[11:35:32] <groovecoder> percent20_: dang, Azure looks pretty sweet.
[11:35:58] <percent20_> groovecoder: they did a good job on the metro themeing.
[11:36:35] <groovecoder> I more mean the platform features - node.js, php, python
[11:36:41] <groovecoder> git deployment
[11:36:45] <groovecoder> integrated with WebMatrix
[11:36:49] <groovecoder> very nice
[11:36:58] <percent20_> I shouldn't be surprised ScottGu is amazing at what ever he does. He really knows the pulse of developers
[11:37:26] <percent20_> groovecoder: yeah you can use Azure as a PaaS or an IaaS or a mix of both.
[11:40:02] <groovecoder> percent20_ if I can move up to 10 WordPress blogs up there for free I'll be happy :)
[11:40:14] <groovecoder> though I don't use WebMatrix so I lose some of that niceness
[11:40:38] <percent20_> I have never been a fan of the webmatrix
[11:40:47] <percent20_> except back in the .NET 1.0 days
[11:45:35] <jwhitlock> http://blog.rightscale.com/2012/06/06/rightscale-azure/
[11:46:12] <jwhitlock> sad that people think PaaS and IaaS don't need explainations
[11:47:21] <percent20_> wow the azure site is using disqus
[12:13:29] <Destos> don't let your guard down! remember IE!
[12:26:33] <percent20_> http://fedscoop.com/is-github-governments-next-big-thing/
[12:27:18] <percent20_> Doing some .NET code. I forgot how nice the .NET framework is. It is very well organized and layed out, and logical.
[12:29:18] <zerokarmaleft> percent20_: the standard library?
[12:29:27] <percent20_> zerokarmaleft: yes
[12:34:21] <percent20_> groovecoder: ouch that article calls sourceforge a github alternative.
[12:37:45] <groovecoder> percent20_: it also calls SourceForge "a pioneer of open source repository platforms."
[12:37:50] <groovecoder> ;)
[12:37:54] <groovecoder> which is pretty much accurate
[12:38:48] <percent20_> agreed, but it relegates the importance of sourceforge, imo, to nothingness.
[12:39:03] <percent20_> that phrasing sucks.
[13:25:28] <zerokarmaleft> http://www.vooza.com/
[13:29:14] <percent20> so the question is.. is that a parody or clever marketing.
[13:56:54] <groovecoder> lulz. I just remembered my clipper ran out of battery last night, so I'm still walking around with only a half-shaved head
[14:00:13] <percent20> lol
[14:27:38] <percent20> groovecoder: I have hit a point in writing tests where I need to do some refactoring of common tasks. Any ideas on something I can read that can point me in the right direction?
[14:34:17] <groovecoder> "refactoring of common tasks" example?
[14:35:58] <zerokarmaleft> wow, steve yegge's js2-mode implements a complete javascript parser
[14:42:27] <groovecoder> percent20: you coming to coworking tomorrow? need you to sign TCF stuff
[14:42:43] <percent20> groovecoder: yes I will be there.
[14:42:50] <percent20> groovecoder: and yes on the refactoring.
[14:44:07] <groovecoder> percent20: well, what's an example of a common task you're refactoring?
[14:45:06] <percent20> basically adding data to the database and haivng a reference to the object.
[14:45:52] <percent20> some of the objects have like over 10 seperate properties to fill populate. Am not wanting to use fixtures because i can't get them to work half the time.
[14:48:11] <groovecoder> percent20: I've used _create_some_required_data() methods before
[14:48:38] <groovecoder> just in your test class, def _create_german_doc(self): blah blah
[14:48:48] <groovecoder> then in your test, self._create_german_doc()
[14:48:51] <groovecoder> something like that?
[14:49:41] <groovecoder> if you want to share it between test classes, you can either stick it in a tests/utils.py module, or you could make a super-class with the method
[14:49:54] <groovecoder> and use the super-class as either the parent or a mixin
[14:51:39] <percent20> okay. i'll mess around with that.
