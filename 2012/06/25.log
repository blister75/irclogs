[07:57:43] <andmakeit> I'm begining to question the stability of nodejitsu.
[07:58:06] <groovecoder1> andmakeit: have you tried node on heroku?
[07:58:45] <andmakeit> I'm going to as soon as I can set it up and close nodejitsu
[07:59:25] <andmakeit> My concern was web sockets.  The playlist page uses them.
[08:05:32] <andmakeit> Destos: good morning.
[08:05:43] <Destos> mornin
[08:10:21] <andmakeit> Destos: have you had a lot of trouble with nodejitsu instances hanging?
[08:12:31] <tulsabot_node> Your http://turntable.fm/tulsawebdevs recap
[08:16:10] <Destos> andmakeit: not sure, I don't watch them like a hawk and only have run potential running

[08:16:35] <andmakeit> Ah
[08:17:22] <andmakeit> Well this is the third time I've had to ask them to kill it
[08:18:50] <groovecoder1> andmakeit: you have to ask them to kill it? that's a problem

[09:15:54] <groovecoder1> was anyone wanting to go to OKC for WordPress meetup this afternoon/evening? I'm leave at 2pm
[09:16:11] <groovecoder1> percent20: I'm going to barely make it for the webdev contributor stewards meeting :)
[09:26:20] <andmakeit> Groovecoder: the instances keep freezing when I restart it.
[09:26:58] <andmakeit> Groovecoder1: ^
[09:27:26] <groovecoder> andmakeit: yeah that sucks
[09:28:09] <andmakeit> Ya.  As soon as they kill it, I'm going to try heroku
[09:48:02] <zerokarmaleft> heh, TDD in clojure with lazy, infinite sequences leads to some fun test failures

[12:00:53] <percent20> groovecoder, oh, linux on my mac still works with external monitor with lid closed, and bluetooth keyboard and mouse right out of the box.
[12:02:11] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: are any of your vagrant setups clustered?
[12:03:28] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: not that I know. vagrant is a dev tool, not a deployment tool
[12:03:41] <groovecoder> @ mozilla I mean
[12:05:02] <zerokarmaleft> there's support for multi-vm environments
[12:05:07] <groovecoder> percent20: this afternoon can you help me test my vidyo room sharing & recording ?
[12:05:40] <percent20> groovecoder, sure when would be a good time to do that? I can help in about an hour.
[12:06:13] <groovecoder> percent20: I'll be traveling 2pm-3:30pm
[12:06:13] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: at some point, i'm going to work on setting up a minimal hadoop cluster consisting entirely of VMs
[12:06:30] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: just as an experiment? :)
[12:06:38] <percent20> groovecoder, oh. are you wanting to do it before or after the meeting?
[12:06:51] <groovecoder> percent20: we can do it after. it's for tonight's WP meeting
[12:06:53] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: to simulate nodes crashing, etc.
[12:07:00] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: ah, cool
[12:07:03] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: good idea
[12:07:03] <percent20> groovecoder, ah okay.
[12:08:09] <zerokarmaleft> also, REPL access to a cluster behaves differently than locally
[12:10:50] <MrMakeIt> bop

[12:13:27] <MrMakeIt> groovecoder: when do you leave for the okc wordpress meeting?

[12:36:54] <MrMakeIt> groovecoder: is it posible i could get a ride?
[12:37:11] <percent20_> am i online?
[12:39:28] <MrMakeIt> yes
[12:39:32] <MrMakeIt> yes you are
[12:42:18] <percent20_> awesome.
[12:42:25] <percent20_> having some odd issues.
[12:42:59] <tulsabot_node> The tunes have stopped.
[12:44:15] <groovecoder> MrMakeIt: sorry I've got to head straight there
[12:44:26] <MrMakeIt> oh.  that's ok.
[12:44:31] <groovecoder> MrMakeIt: but it looks like I'll have a vidyo link to share
[12:44:40] <groovecoder> MrMakeIt: if you can d/l vidyo you can join in
[12:44:42] <MrMakeIt> cool
[12:44:44] <tulsabot_node> The tunes have stopped.
[12:44:46] <MrMakeIt> already have it
[12:45:14] <groovecoder> MrMakeIt: cool, craig and jake and I are going to test the vidyo connection stuff early at about 6pm or so
[12:45:24] <MrMakeIt> sounds good.

[13:41:24] <jonathan__> Anyone here have experience with Arduino and Lego NXT?  Looking for a birthday present for my 10-year-old.
[13:41:44] <jonathan__> I have the opportunity to get an NXT 1 for $50, but his computer is Linux.  I didn't know if Arduino would be too much for him.
[13:42:20] <jonathan__> But the pieces to NXT seem to be expensive, and on Linux its a bit of a hack-job anyway.  or can you start with NXT and add regular non-Lego components?
[13:42:22] <percent20> MrMakeIt ^
[13:44:27] <MrMakeIt> My recommendation would be the ntx. they're easier for kids to work with hardware wise.  If you have too much trouble with the Linux version, wine support is high.
[13:44:34] <MrMakeIt> *nxt
[13:46:18] <jonathan__> Cool.  Thanks!

[15:24:02] <percent20> groovecoder, good. Going to do a video that is me behind a camera talking. heh.
[15:25:49] <jwhitlock> groovecoder: read Harry's email.  sad.

[15:27:04] <percent20> harry?
[15:31:21] <jwhitlock> Harry is the Tulsa Transit guy
[15:32:53] <jwhitlock> To paraphrase, the contract with Trapeze limits how much they can tell us about Trapeze, especially around data and GUI
[15:33:05] <groovecoder> !trapeze--
[15:33:05] <tulsabot_node> trapeze has null awesome points.
