[11:55:09] <percent20_> lol. Have people in from out of town at work so I am sitting in a common area trying to do work. Comfortable seat though.
[12:02:27] <zerokarmaleft> are they squatting your desk or something?
[12:03:49] <percent20_> I don't have one officially, but we have where a secretary is supposed to sit and i sit there. People from out of town have priorty for it.
[12:04:12] <percent20_> I very much dislike where i am professionally right now.
[12:05:35] <groovecoder> percent20_: heh, what do you mean? (or was that wrong window?)
[12:06:27] <percent20_> groovecoder: I just dislike working here at waterfield, but I don't have enough other work to leave or strong enough resume to go where I want. It feels like everything I do I earn very little.
[12:07:09] <groovecoder> percent20_: ah, yeah's one of those career plateau's eh?
[12:07:59] <percent20_> atm. yeah. Can't seem to break it. Hopefully the meeting next friday will bear some fruit.

[12:15:32] <percent20_> I was thinking express for Node.js was modeled after sinatra. I wonder if anyone has started a Node.js web framework that is modeled after rails or django.
[12:17:28] <Destos> quite possibly
[12:17:46] <Destos> there are quite a few node frameworks. but I haven't investigated much beyond express
[12:18:44] <percent20_> Destos: ah. I am looking at geddy right now. http://geddyjs.org
[12:19:47] <percent20_> it is looking very much like rails
[12:19:58] <Destos> thats good, nice that its integrated with bs
[12:21:03] <percent20_> holy crap this is rails
[12:49:19] <Destos> lol
