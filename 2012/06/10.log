[11:32:41] <tulsabot> yum! thank youDJMakeIt
[11:35:05] <DJMakeIt> zerokarmaleft:  sorry about the extra on the irc.  i had been testing locally, but when i moved it to the main server, everything kept falling apart.  Things just weren't working the same.
[11:36:30] <DJMakeIt> I'm looking into why that kept happening.  it seemed to be a problem between how my ircd was talking vs how freenode was.  not sure how to fix it.
