[15:55:56] <jwhitlock> Does the !jwhitlock++ have to be at the front of the line?
[15:56:01] <jwhitlock> I guess so
[15:56:03] <mrmakeit> tulsabot_node has a loop protection but tulsabot_ is breaking.

[16:10:59] <mrmakeit> "number" = number but not A number
[16:11:25] <groovecoder> NaN is a number type that means "not a number"
