(11:30:34 pm) percent20: I am trying to do a test and use reverse shortcut
(11:31:01 pm) percent20: my url is: url(r'^(?P<username>[-\w]+)/$', 'accounts.views.profile', name="profile"),
(11:31:16 pm) percent20: but i don't know how to use the reverse shortcut to call that and pass username as well.
(11:31:51 pm) groovecoder: percent20: reverse('profile', args=[username]) I think
(11:32:48 pm) percent20: okay i'll try that. also does my view function for doing a url like that supposed to look like this: def profile(request, username):
(11:32:57 pm) groovecoder: yup
(11:33:12 pm) shanecowherd: hiya
(11:33:14 pm) percent20: okay. something feels odd about that, but if that is how it works is probably me just staring at it to long

(11:35:13 pm) shanecowherd: they did a great job
(11:35:20 pm) groovecoder: I mean, the 3rd spider man was terrible ... maybe that's a good enough reason to reboot it

(11:45:22 pm) shanecowherd: percent20, can you add a feature to the bot
(11:45:26 pm) groovecoder: I group. top group is standard python libs, then 3rd-party python libs, then django libs, then 3rd-party django libs, then my modules
