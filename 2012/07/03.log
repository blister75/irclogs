(03:06:01 pm) zerokarmaleft: timmorgan: ping
(03:06:15 pm) timmorgan: zerokarmaleft: hi
(03:06:30 pm) zerokarmaleft: timmorgan: do you do any headless TDD in node.js?
(03:07:03 pm) timmorgan: no, that's an area I haven't invested a lot in
(03:07:07 pm) zerokarmaleft: rather, any TDD/BDD with node.js
(03:07:15 pm) timmorgan: I've used Jasmine in the browser to test Backbone
(03:07:22 pm) timmorgan: but not TDD on node.js yet
(03:08:15 pm) timmorgan: ok, I lied, I've done a itsy bitsy bit: https://github.com/seven1m/sooner.io/blob/master/spec/formHelpersSpec.coffee
(03:08:45 pm) timmorgan: https://github.com/seven1m/sooner.io/blob/master/spec/sandboxSpec.coffee
(03:10:30 pm) timmorgan: zerokarmaleft: and you?
(03:10:35 pm) zerokarmaleft: timmorgan: related: did you see the topics for the july meeting?
(03:10:40 pm) timmorgan: nope not yet
(03:11:26 pm) zerokarmaleft: i suggested doing a simple code kata in different languages
(03:11:55 pm) timmorgan: nice
(03:12:08 pm) zerokarmaleft: we have such a varying skill level in the group
(03:12:18 pm) zerokarmaleft: it'd be nice to do something accessible to everyone
(03:12:34 pm) timmorgan: indeed
(03:12:42 pm) zerokarmaleft: whether it be foundational TDD or just learning some new tools
(03:12:53 pm) timmorgan: tulsawebdevs.org is not responding for me
(03:13:01 pm) zerokarmaleft: it's on facebook
(03:13:21 pm) zerokarmaleft: i'm not sure how it would work out with multiple presenters/multiple languages
(03:14:17 pm) zerokarmaleft: but if we went that route, it'd make more sense if you or Destos or someone else with more node under their belt would lead that
(03:14:41 pm) timmorgan: I just hope it wouldn't degenerate into 'who can make the most obfuscated one-liner in their favorite language'
(03:14:47 pm) timmorgan: ok
(03:15:02 pm) zerokarmaleft: the other option is to just go javascript
(03:15:11 pm) zerokarmaleft: and do something like a swarm-coding session
(03:15:28 pm) zerokarmaleft: http://technomancy.us/162
(03:16:38 pm) timmorgan: that could be cool
(03:16:55 pm) zerokarmaleft: i think that's actually the way we should go
(03:17:00 pm) timmorgan: though I tend to prefer code that's prepared before-hand -- watching someone type can get very tiring
(03:17:30 pm) zerokarmaleft: that shouldn't be as big of a deal with a code kata
(03:17:47 pm) zerokarmaleft: the point is to get people familiar with thinking through the solution, even going down wrong paths
(03:17:50 pm) timmorgan: either option sounds awesome though!
(03:18:06 pm) timmorgan: yeah, that could really be helpful
(03:22:06 pm) zerokarmaleft: anyway, food for though...i'm crashing my way through jasmine atm
(03:22:12 pm) zerokarmaleft: s/though/thought*
(03:27:39 pm) groovecoder: zerokarmaleft: I bet beginner + intermediate + advanced javascript code-swarming would be really good
(03:28:06 pm) groovecoder: i.e., set up a beginner, an intermediate, and an advanced javascript coding exercise
(03:28:17 pm) groovecoder: everyone loves teh javascript
(03:33:19 pm) Destos: its the best worst language out there!
(03:33:29 pm) zerokarmaleft: Destos: so true :-/
(03:34:54 pm) groovecoder: Destos: you in the zed shaw school now?
(03:44:31 pm) zerokarmaleft: groovecoder: maybe a tooling workshop+really simple example would work well as a beginner track, and a more thorough example as an intermediate track?
(03:45:32 pm) groovecoder: zerokarmaleft: you thinking all this is node.js stuff?
(03:45:58 pm) groovecoder: we might get buddy to convert his "Intro to node" talk into a "intro to node" kata
(03:46:15 pm) zerokarmaleft: groovecoder: atm i'm using jasmine-node, but it's not TDD for writing node apps per se
(03:46:36 pm) zerokarmaleft: i wanted to separate focus from that, otherwise it's too much cognitive load
(03:47:26 pm) zerokarmaleft: jasmine-node basically gives you a traditional console test runner output
(03:47:42 pm) zerokarmaleft: instead of running in browser, which just feels utterly wrong to me
(03:47:56 pm) groovecoder: zerokarmaleft: heh
(03:48:37 pm) zerokarmaleft: TDD for node.js services might be a topic worth investigating in the future, though
(04:44:16 pm) Destos: zerokarmaleft: I'm looking at testem recently, going to try and integrate that into our testing env
(04:44:19 pm) Destos: https://github.com/airportyh/testem
(04:44:56 pm) Destos: allows you to test on all installed browsers with your preferred testing framework
