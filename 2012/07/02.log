(11:34:38 am) groovecoder: zerokarmaleft: fun fact: I actually *bought* an ocarina and learned a bunch of those songs on it ><
(11:35:09 am) zerokarmaleft: left right up! left right up!
(11:35:51 am) percent20: I did that all with javscript and canvas. No libraries at all.
(11:35:52 am) Destos: dedication
(11:36:16 am) percent20: and Destos saved me on the image flickering as well.
(11:36:31 am) Destos: you would've figured it out
(11:36:39 am) Destos: with enough frustration and anger!
(11:36:59 am) percent20: It was about to go on stackoverflow
(11:37:23 am) zerokarmaleft: just gotta turn it into a proper sprite now with alpha blending :D
(11:37:41 am) percent20: heh.
(11:37:52 am) percent20: there is a lot to do if I want to take it any further.
(11:38:13 am) zerokarmaleft: i did something like this many years ago with Terra from Final Fantasy VI
(11:39:31 am) zerokarmaleft: it was part of a larger project to make a multiplayer game where you raced through a maze
(11:40:11 am) percent20: that is cool. You should remake that with HTML5
(11:40:47 am) zerokarmaleft: oddly enough, i've been studying maze generation again lately
(11:41:52 am) zerokarmaleft: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap <= specifically, wilson's algorithm in clojure, but these javascript demos are fun to watch
(11:42:20 am) zerokarmaleft: the actual generation algorithms are in ruby, and the visualizations are coffeescript
(11:43:42 am) zerokarmaleft: also, fun may be a subjective term for people that also find enjoyment from watching a disk defragger at work
