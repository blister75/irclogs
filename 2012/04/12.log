[13:08:18] <percent2_> holy crap. Fracking is a real word. It means "Hydrolic Fracturing" and is used in drilling for natural gas.
[13:09:50] <groovecoder> percent2_: yeah, I always have BSG flash-backs when I hear people talk about fraking
[13:10:20] <percent2_> I first heard it in farscape back in the day.
[13:11:10] <percent2_> so what am i supposed to do tomorrow on the ruby scraping thing. i still haven't figured that out.
[13:15:17] <groovecoder|afk> percent2_: just be yourself ;)
[13:15:30] <percent2_> greaaat. okay.
[13:16:52] <groovecoder|afk> percent2_: I'll chat w/ you later about it. you going to speakers' dinner?

[13:56:57] <groovecoder> percent2_: maybe/probably. I'm going to help stuff swag bags. but afterwards I'm going to meet up with my bro for drinks and stuff too
[13:56:59] <percent2_> i'll be at OSU-Tulsa and generally get out at 6:20 to 6:30, but the class doesn't officially end until 7:20.
