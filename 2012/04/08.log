[14:30:12] <SeanW122> and they are?
[14:33:50] <percent20> Destos and Groovecoder. preferably in that order.
[14:36:07] <percent20> SeanW122: would you be interested in doing a hackday where you spend the day coding a "universal" site for non-profits along with using and learning Node.js?
[15:15:16] <SeanW122> percent20: do you mean personally or a group thing?
[15:15:25] <percent20> personally
[15:15:31] <MattGalloway> Is anyone on that knows anything about TRIF feeds?
[15:15:45] <MattGalloway> Oh yeah, Happy Easter or whatever. :)
[15:15:55] <percent20> jwhitlock_zzz and jsatt do, but not sure if they are around.
