[02:05:04] <MattGalloway> sephillips: Man, you're up late.
[10:50:03] <percent20> !hello
[11:09:49] <Destos> percent20: is listening to paris hilton
[11:10:41] <Destos> and now lady gaga

[13:13:10] <ZiggyTheHamster> ni hao, tulsabot_!
[13:58:07] <jaeger> http://jaeger.morpheus.net/misc/bargl.png <-- I should probably fix this
[13:58:51] <ZiggyTheHamster> enable console UTF-8. kind of a PITA, but once you do it, it's much nicer
[13:59:03] <ZiggyTheHamster> and wget prints out smart quotes (not really a pro, but worth mentioning)
[14:00:35] <jaeger> I thought I had it enabled, I must be missing something
[14:01:45] <jaeger> irssi's term_charset is utf-8, LANG is en_US.UTF-8, screen -U
[14:03:54] <ZiggyTheHamster> maybe your font doesn't have unicode
[14:04:08] <jaeger> It should, I checked that... Liberation Mono
[14:04:31] <jaeger> I wonder if my local locales are wrong or if xfce terminal is built wrong, perhaps
[14:05:27] <jaeger> It's aggravating because I've had it working before, not sure what I changed
[14:06:03] <jaeger> hrmm... it looks different in xterm but still wrong
[14:11:01] <jaeger> Any of you happen to have an archlinux or gentoo install handy?
[14:13:42] <jaeger> ooh, never mind, I found what I was looking for in an ubuntu install
[15:17:55] <percent20> http://coderwall.com/buddylindsey
[15:36:50] <jaeger> coding achievements? what the fuck, internet?
[15:41:52] <percent20> we need achievements too.

[17:25:08] <percent20> !karam?
[17:25:12] <percent20> !karma?
[17:28:07] <percent20> !karma?

[17:30:35] <danf1> Dang. percent20 is going down fast.
[17:35:25] <jaeger> Now you need a bot to repeatedly lower karma
[17:35:29] <jaeger> otherwise that's gonna take a while
[17:54:38] <percent20> heh
[21:09:09] <chimchim237> mic check
[21:53:32] <percent20> i'm here. :)
[22:23:47] <chimchim237> instantbird works after all.
[22:23:49] <chimchim237> nea.
[22:23:52] <chimchim237> neat*
[23:15:59] <shat_> well this blows.
[23:16:11] <shat_> someone broke into my truck while we were in cheesecake factory at dinner
[23:16:38] <chimchim237> shit
[23:16:43] <shat_> yup.
[23:16:47] <shat_> bad bad bad
[23:17:03] <shat_> because Transmit for example at least the version on my laptop doesn't prompt for admin password to unlock the keys
[23:17:07] <shat_> it just keeps them
