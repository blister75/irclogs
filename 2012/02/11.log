[15:13:36] <percent20_> groovecoder: BrowserID support was just added to django-social-auth
[15:13:53] <groovecoder> percent20_: oh yeah? link?
[15:14:26] <percent20_> https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth/issues/228
[15:15:22] <groovecoder> cool!
[15:15:28] <groovecoder> how'd you track that so close? :)
[15:16:05] <percent20_> I watch django-social-auth repo and was going through the github stream.
[15:16:37] <percent20_> Someone else is also doing a heroku script: https://github.com/jgorset/kingpin
[15:17:00] <percent20_> his is more elegant though
[15:17:19] <MattGalloway> percent20_: And you wonder why you can't find a date.
[15:17:42] <percent20_> MattGalloway: I have never wondered, I am quite well aware.
[15:18:13] <percent20_> My problem is more finding a woman who meets my standards.
[15:19:19] <percent20_> groovecoder: I still want to do a browser id video for godjango. However I might make it a bit longer and do browser id using the mozilla gem then at the end implement it using django-social-auth.
[15:19:44] <groovecoder> percent20_: yeah I'd say compare all the implementations
[15:22:27] <percent20_> well I want to highlight the mozilla library because some people might not want to have the overhead of django-social-auth. I personally am excited it is baked in because it will make it easier to do godjango auth with browser id and github

[15:26:01] <shat_> Afternoon.
[15:28:52] <percent20_> that sucks. It looks like the django devs half ignore documentation pull requests. :(
[15:28:59] <percent20_> shat_: hello
[15:30:57] <shat_> How goes it?
[15:31:53] <MattGalloway> shat_: Sorry to hear about your truck. That's sucks.
[15:32:02] <shat_> Thanks Matt.
[15:32:24] <shat_> I think I've gotten everything changed up.  Hopefully, well best REALISTIC case is they wipe everything and got some free HDDs and laptops.
[15:32:34] <shat_> Otherwise, I guess they just scored a motherload of info ;)
[15:32:49] <groovecoder> shat_: d'oh!
[15:33:10] <shat_> hope they are smart enough to wipe and reinstall ;)
[15:33:21] <groovecoder> this book is interesting: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020103.do
[15:34:50] <MattGalloway> shat_: I hadn't thought about reinstalling, but a little hint on the password would be nice... uh, oh... I mean, yeah, I hope those thugs reinstall. ;)
[15:35:26] <shat_> ha.
[15:35:26] <shat_> ;)
[15:35:40] <shat_> shitty part, I think password on login was disabled.
[15:35:41] <shat_> ;(
[15:35:49] <shat_> at least for one account.
[15:35:52] <shat_> not the admin or anything.
[15:35:57] <shat_> Eitehr way. safe than sorry
[15:36:13] <MattGalloway> groovecoder: I love the cover art. Hysterical.
[16:44:58] <MattGalloway> In case you were wondering...the maximum files size to upload to Dropbox from iOS using the Dropbox API is 180MB. Dammit.
[16:59:38] <chimchim237> wonder if box.net performs any better.
[21:28:47] <percent20> groovecoder: can you get to this link? https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/24809009
[21:28:56] <percent20> i get json back saying I am signed out.
[23:26:33] <MattGalloway> percent20: I get: {"message":"You have been signed out.","status":"SIGNOUT"}
[23:27:01] <percent20> thanks.
