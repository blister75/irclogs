[10:54:42] <ZiggyTheHamster> groovecoder: I use Gentoo.
[10:55:32] <ZiggyTheHamster> percent20: CouchDB FTW :)

[13:40:16] <percent20> anyone use Command-T in vim? https://wincent.com/products/command-t
[14:06:10] <shat> no
[14:06:23] <shat> nerdtree is the most file system interaction I get in vim.
[15:24:25] <percent20> groovecoder: I just bcc'd you on a convo i had with a friend with a scary thought I just had about macs in the future.
[15:27:51] <zerokarmaleft> percent20: i use ido-mode in emacs, which does fuzzy matching for everything, not just files
[15:27:57] <zerokarmaleft> it's handy
[15:51:37] <percent20> about to post a bit of a trolling/concerned blog post

[15:54:34] <percent20> if anyone wants to the can upvote this: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3600838
[16:05:12] <danf1> percent20: Your post is the first time I have heard of Mountain Lion. I seriously thought it was a joke at first.
[16:05:30] <percent20> they just announced it today.
[16:05:46] <danf1> Yeah, I'm watching the sneak peek video on apple.com now.
[17:16:53] <percent20> groovecoder: remeber that image site from yesterday. I let me script run for about 10 hours to pull imgaes. I got about 8 gig of images. I started doing the math on their id permuatations and decided to stop getting images as they had roughly 3.4TB of images. I am not quite that annoyed with them.
[17:17:57] <esdev> lemme see, 10 hrs, 8gb. 3.4tb total. You'll be done in no time. :P
[17:18:28] <percent20> heh yeah. and that was with getting an image every 4 seconds.
[17:18:55] <zerokarmaleft> where are you soaking up bandwidth?
[17:19:22] <percent20> OSU-Tulsa was 3 git and home was the other 5
[17:19:33] <percent20> git = gig
[17:19:56] <zerokarmaleft> deploy it on csx
[17:20:16] <percent20> LOL.
[17:20:30] <zerokarmaleft> on all the servers, coordinate between the scripts to divvy the workload
[17:20:41] <zerokarmaleft> then hammer this shit out of it
[17:20:58] <zerokarmaleft> it's an exercise in distributed concurrency...
[17:21:01] <esdev> what is csx?
[17:21:08] <percent20> LOL.
[17:21:24] <percent20> esdev: OSU-Tulsa's CS server for students and faculty
[17:21:34] <esdev> o i c
[17:22:17] <percent20> zerokarmaleft: actually, I have done enough with drb i could probably write a truely distributed app to do that.
[17:25:59] <percent20> if I uploaded all 8 gig of images to flickr on my premium account i wonder what they would think. heh.
[17:26:53] <zerokarmaleft> what image site are you trolling?
[17:30:38] <percent20> ow.ly
[17:30:49] <percent20> hootsuite's image service.
[17:31:03] <percent20> they wouldn't let me right click on an image.
[17:31:51] <percent20> it took me about 60 seconds to figure out their naming scheme and another 60 to write a script to start yanking images.
[17:33:17] <percent20> the bad thing is when dealing with random images you get random images, and some you cannot unsee. :(
[17:33:55] <esdev> *insert retinal bleach and mind floss here*
[17:34:33] <zerokarmaleft> i know some guys that used to work on web filtering software, they basically spent most of their working day looking up the internet's asshole
[17:34:49] <zerokarmaleft> then writing rules to filter what they found
[17:35:01] <esdev> and that is a stinky way to earn a living
[17:35:35] <zerokarmaleft> i'm sure they did other things, but that's mainly what they bitched about...with good reason
[17:36:13] <percent20> yeah.
[17:37:55] <zerokarmaleft> s/bitched/complained/
[17:38:15] <zerokarmaleft> seems contradictory to say someone bitched with good reason
[20:47:14] <percent20> !weather
[21:16:06] <percent20> I think I am pushing to hard on my walk/jog I feel rather close to getting shin splints.
