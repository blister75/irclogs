[00:22:12] <percent20> groovecoder: did the nightly update break css for you?
[00:22:25] <groovecoder> haven't noticed, no
[00:22:53] <percent20> hrm. okay. Seems like in nightly no css is working now.
[00:23:03] <percent20> when I upgraded to 13
[00:48:46] <percent20> groovecoder: out of curiosity is there a beta up of the new tulsawebdevs design?
[00:53:12] <groovecoder> percent20: nope. don't think we have a new twd design
[00:53:33] <percent20> ah I thought that is what Destos was working on.
[00:53:38] <percent20> or was it just tulsa hackathon
