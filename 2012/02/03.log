[12:24:35] <codelahoma> groovecoder: HELP! Just installed FF 10.0 from the release channel on my new work laptop and the page paints are so slow they look like a curtain drop effect.
[12:24:51] <groovecoder> codelahoma: install beta or aurora? :)
[12:25:50] <codelahoma> ACTION fixed it
[12:26:19] <codelahoma> by turning OFF "use hardware acceleration when available.
[12:26:24] <groovecoder> ah, dang.
[12:26:27] <groovecoder> file a bug?
[12:26:38] <groovecoder> codelahoma: windows? mac? linux?
[12:26:44] <codelahoma> windows
[12:26:55] <codelahoma> lemme check what the graphics chipset is...
[12:27:04] <codelahoma> XP, Service Pack 3
[12:27:19] <groovecoder> codelahoma: extra fun wrinkle - yesterday was FF 10 release AND a Microsoft patch tuesday
[12:28:10] <codelahoma> I had no idea. I just happened to need FF for the first time on this machine today.
[12:28:25] <codelahoma> all windows will tell me is that it's Intel HD Graphics
[12:28:37] <codelahoma> Lenovo Thinkpad T410
[12:35:41] <codelahoma> ahhh...it's the graphics built into the Core i5 processor.
[12:35:51] <codelahoma> (I didn't know they'd done such a thing)
[13:05:14] <percent20> http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ZYK3SLH <- if you have done any django can you please do this survey?
[13:09:16] <zerokarmaleft> i was tempted to fill in both form entries with "Hello. Firefox is doesnt correctly work with devexpress. present to your info"
[13:11:01] <percent20> lol
[13:13:40] <zerokarmaleft> !karma?
[13:14:16] <percent20> ACTION flexes
[13:14:23] <zerokarmaleft> riiight.
[13:14:28] <percent20> !zerokarmaleft++
[13:15:34] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: I got an even better one today: "creating an interactive platform about mathematical games to guess italian superenalotto using sense of music to extract signals from noise. In general the topic is valuable in a lot of things, not only guessing the italian superenalotto"
[13:21:37] <MrMakeIt> what is the current project?
[13:30:20] <groovecoder> MrMakeIt: what current project?
[13:30:41] <MrMakeIt> Sorry wrong room.
[13:30:47] <groovecoder> heh
[13:31:17] <MrMakeIt> So how is Hack-a--Thon prep coming?
[13:31:27] <groovecoder> pretty good
[13:31:35] <MrMakeIt> Good to know.
[13:31:58] <MrMakeIt> You guys have anything a lowly python programmer could do?
[13:33:29] <groovecoder> MrMakeIt: sure. https://github.com/tulsawebdevs/python-scrapers ? :)
[13:33:41] <MrMakeIt> cool thanks.
[13:33:50] <groovecoder> jsatt: jwhitlock_zzz: jsatt: you all done lunch yet?
[13:34:04] <groovecoder> want to come to Fab Lab for a photo-shoot of coworking? need to stage more people
[13:34:21] <MrMakeIt> I am planing to be there at about 4
[13:34:39] <MrMakeIt> would that be too late?
[13:35:41] <MrMakeIt> Destos: could you send me an answer to that on gmail?  i got to go.
[13:36:17] <Destos> ?
[15:03:14] <shat> Everyone still at Freddie's?
[15:27:45] <shat> perfect time to connect the new battery backup... right after the power went out ;/
[15:35:01] <groovecoder> Randall: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_control
[15:39:42] <MrMakeIt> Destos: hey
[15:40:21] <Destos> Yo
[15:50:35] <Randall> yo
[15:51:19] <percent20> !weather tulsa
[15:53:50] <Destos> percent20: what could the command be to use pbcopy to write to a new file?
[15:54:16] <Destos> echo > file.txt | pbcopy
[15:54:19] <Destos> I duno my pipes!
[15:55:16] <percent20> pbpaste > file.txt
[15:55:20] <Destos> so simple
[15:55:32] <percent20> i just looked it up. ;)
[15:55:42] <Destos> I could've too
[15:55:48] <Destos> but me lazy
[15:55:53] <percent20> well, sorta. I did man pbcopy
[15:55:59] <percent20> then it told me about pbpaste
[15:56:08] <percent20> so I just guessed and did pbpaste > file.txt and it worked
[15:56:54] <Destos> ah, forgot about the alternate command
[15:57:02] <Destos> watch this, I'm sitting right next to him but I'll message luke on irc
[15:57:12] <Destos> groovecoder: I might need my power brick back in 30 minutes.
[15:57:34] <percent20> lol
[15:57:50] <percent20> and thus the great power exchange has finished
[15:58:06] <Destos> my mac thanks ye
[16:07:46] <percent20> groovecoder: how do  you stop mysql
[16:07:55] <codelahoma> aaaand...just like that, I won't be at coworking in two weeks. Emerson's out of school that day.
[16:08:03] <percent20> i stared msyqld in cli without setting it as background process and now I can't get it to stop.
[16:08:05] <codelahoma> we might come down for lunch, though.
[16:08:42] <codelahoma> percent20: what kind of system?
[16:08:54] <percent20> on my mac. ctrl+c doesn't work
[16:09:27] <codelahoma> open another terminal and 'ps aux | grep mysql', then 'kill $PID'
[16:09:43] <codelahoma> I'm sure there's a cleaner way, but that would do it.
[16:09:59] <percent20> i was thinking about that. was hoping there was a shortcut I didn't know about.
[16:10:32] <percent20> http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/189776 <- git is to slow for facebook.
[16:10:36] <codelahoma> Ctrl-Z to background it, then exit could do it.
[16:13:16] <codelahoma> percent20: in another terminal: 'mysqladmin -u root shutdown'
[16:13:38] <codelahoma> also '-p' if there's a password on mysql's root
[16:14:02] <percent20> :D it worked. you the man.
[16:14:07] <percent20> never thought of that before.
[16:16:30] <codelahoma> google is your friend :-)
[16:17:31] <codelahoma> groovecoder: weirdest thing. Can't login to github in FF 10 or FF 10.06b....installing aurora now
[16:17:50] <groovecoder> 10.06b ?
[16:18:12] <codelahoma> whatever the beta version is. I don't have it open (I'm installing aurora)
[16:18:44] <percent20> Destos: um.... is PHP supposed to work with OSX apache by default?
[16:18:56] <percent20> nevermind
[16:18:58] <codelahoma> 10.0b6
[16:23:50] <percent20> Destos: I did some googling on the dummy data for wordpress couldn't find it.
[16:23:53] <percent20> any ideas?
[16:31:19] <shat> percent20: you needing a .xml file of just random content?
[16:31:47] <percent20> shat: i think i found one to download just was using the wrong search terms.
[16:32:28] <shat> Okay.  I think we have one laying around some where we use.
[16:32:34] <shat> It has some silly place holder images and such.
[16:32:54] <shat> I really don't know why I don't have this yet... or why I can't find one that works the way I want it to ..
[16:33:06] <shat> But a simple php script I can drop into a folder, specify $imagepath = "whatever/"
[16:33:24] <shat> and it use timthumb to just create a simple simple gallery of the photos in $imagepath.
[16:33:38] <shat> Don't care about thickbox, modal or any of that non sense, just something minimal.
[16:33:54] <percent20> sounds like a cool idea.
[16:35:15] <shat> surely it been done,
[16:35:29] <shat> ha, love when my pops shows up randomly at the office with something.  Today he "found a neat paper" haha
[16:35:32] <shat> brb
[16:36:26] <shat> actually, I think I"m going to head out.  Maybe be on later when I am at home.
[16:37:13] <shat> It was great chatting with you guys (girl) today.  I'll get everyone's email info later or if you want, shoot me your info individually justin@justtheweb.com -- I'll jump on FB and the google group etc.
[16:38:22] <Destos> coolio, was great meeting you today shat
[16:44:24] <percent20> WOOHOO got it all working :D
[16:44:52] <percent20> now I don't have to kill myself everytime I want to do wordpress with 1000 differing possible solutions. Destos wins the game.
[16:45:10] <Destos> karma? :D
