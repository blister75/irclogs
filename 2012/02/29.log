[08:14:58] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder|food: that's pretty neat
[08:26:46] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: yeah, B2G would be a great win for openness in the mobile space
[08:42:50] <zerokarmaleft> though a bit of an underwhelming sell for your average consumer
[08:43:03] <zerokarmaleft> basically feature parity, except done in html5
[09:11:31] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: yeah, the sell right now is at web developers
[09:12:14] <groovecoder> web developers who are interested in mobile, but they look at iOS vs. Android vs. PhoneGap vs. Titanium vs. Windows Phone vs. Blackberry vs. ____ and go "wtf? why is this so complicated?"
[09:46:37] <MrMakeIt> Destos: what's up
[09:47:32] <Destos> doing taxes and crying
[09:47:40] <MrMakeIt> lol

[09:53:15] <Destos> screw ben franklin
[09:55:52] <MrMakeIt> ?
[09:56:14] <MrMakeIt> oh nvm
[12:23:00] <MrMakeIt> Destos: could you check projectmakeit for me? see if it is working?
[12:29:49] <Destos> MrMakeIt: appears to be working
