[14:29:29] <groovecoder> heh, Google is using https://github.com/mozilla/socorro to collect Chrome crash reports :)
[14:39:51] <percent20_> I am starting to think that my video recording problem is a lion issue not my screen capture app
[14:45:43] <groovecoder> lol. my reggae pandora channel just started playing a song called "legalize it"
[14:45:50] <percent20_> lol.
[14:46:17] <percent20_> I think I might need to get a premium pandora subscription again. I already hit my 40 hours this month.
[14:46:55] <groovecoder> 40 hours per month? is that a hard limit now?
[14:53:36] <percent20_> yeah
[14:53:46] <percent20_> something like less than 1% hit that limit
[14:53:57] <percent20_> I am not one of the other 99%
